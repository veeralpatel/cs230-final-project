       "      <th>Unlike Next, which we'd eaten at the previous night, where each dish is completely recognizable but notable for being the best possible incarnation of itself, Alinea delivers a meal created by Willy Wonka, with all the rules thrown out the window. I won't recount every course, just highlight the dishes that made me laugh, or let me know this was a restaurant like no other, a place where there were no rules that had to be followed, a sanctuary which allowed a chef freedom to go wherever imagination led. For example, while the beverage choices were explained, six bowls containing blocks of ice resting on beds of pebbles were placed on the table, without a word being said about what they were for. Each block had a hole drilled in the center, and once we'd made our decisions about what we'd be drinking, servers then came to the table with glass straws filled with steelhead roe in a liquid and stoppered at either end with foam. We were instructed to take our straws, fit them into the perfectly sized hole, now filled with ice melt, and inhale the mixture in a single slurp as quickly and as loudly as we could. The frigid rush of roe and herbs and peach (I'm unsure whether that fruit flavor came from the straw or the melt) was sweet and salty and made us giggle, a perfect start to the most unusual meal of my life. For Lamb 86, we were each presented with a narrow plate containing three perfect pieces of lamb, each prepared in a different manner, and two plexiglas shields were placed in the center of the table, each with 86 different garnishes, none of them identified, but all, we were promised, fitting accompaniments to the lamb. I cut the three tender servings into three smaller pieces so I could experience more of the flavor combinations, and the table turned into a guessing game as we each plucked the sides that tempted us and tried to identify what we'd chosen. Not every course was as unusual in its presentation as that. Some courses astonished with their perfection alone. Hot Potato, Cold Potato, which we were told was one of the oldest courses that still remained on the Alinea menu, consisted of a paraffin bowl filled with cold potato soup, while a hot potato and a piece of truffle were held aloft by a skewer which went through the lip of the bowl. We were to pull the pin, and the moment the two ingredients met, we were to toss it back, so the soup had no time to warm, the potato no time to chill, and the two flavors and temperatures only came together on the tongue. Then there was the Black Truffle Explosion, which was served on a spoon, and to be chewed with closed lips, so none of the delectable juice escaped. These awed not by the science fictional nature of their presentations, but from the precise combination of their ingredients, eaten at exactly the right moment. One course that makes clear why a dish must be eaten when served is the green apple helium balloon, which if not ingested upon delivery, would, I fear, end up collapsing upon itself before eaten. The skin of the balloon as well as the string with which we held it were both made of apply taffy, and we were told to press our lips against the balloon, take a bite, and inhale. My mouth filled immediately with the intense flavor of apple--and with helium as well, of course--so we were all soon talking about how amazing it tasted while sounding like Mickey and Minnie Mouse. For our final course, the table was cleared, and we were asked to lift our glasses as a silicone covering was rolled out. Servers then brought many small bowls, two metal jugs sweating with condensation, and three white globes with circular holes in their tops. Then two chefs arrived, and began spooning out the contents of the bowls onto the table, scattering them like culinary Jackson Pollacks as they identified each--freeze-dried strawberry, English pea, buttermilk cream, and so on. Then the chefs each lifted a jug and announced, \"liquid nitrogen,\" and poured the contents into the white globes, which caused a fog to rise and cover the table. Finally, the chefs lifted the globes, which were made of white chocolate, and smashed them upon the table, revealing the goodies within--meringues, cotton candy, miniature jelly donuts, condensed honeydew melon, and more. After which we took our spoons and attacked, not making as much of a dent as the creation deserved. At meal's end, we stepped out of the restaurant ... four hours and thirty-nine minutes after we had arrived. Yes. The meal took four hours and thirty-nine minutes. But I assure you that it did not feel as if that much time had passed, because ... oh, I'm going to go into cliche mode now, but you know how it's sometimes said that time stood still? Well, time didn't stand still, per se, but ... let's just say that while we were in Alinea, it didn't exist. We were outside of time, in a pocket universe all to ourselves.</th>\n",

       "      Unlike Next, which we'd eaten at the previous night, where each dish is completely recognizable but notable for being the best possible incarnation of itself, Alinea delivers a meal created by Willy Wonka, with all the rules thrown out the window. I won't recount every course, just highlight the dishes that made me laugh, or let me know this was a restaurant like no other, a place where there were no rules that had to be followed, a sanctuary which allowed a chef freedom to go wherever imagination led. For example, while the beverage choices were explained, six bowls containing blocks of ice resting on beds of pebbles were placed on the table, without a word being said about what they were for. Each block had a hole drilled in the center, and once we'd made our decisions about what we'd be drinking, servers then came to the table with glass straws filled with steelhead roe in a liquid and stoppered at either end with foam. We were instructed to take our straws, fit them into the perfectly sized hole, now filled with ice melt, and inhale the mixture in a single slurp as quickly and as loudly as we could. The frigid rush of roe and herbs and peach (I'm unsure whether that fruit flavor came from the straw or the melt) was sweet and salty and made us giggle, a perfect start to the most unusual meal of my life. For Lamb 86, we were each presented with a narrow plate containing three perfect pieces of lamb, each prepared in a different manner, and two plexiglas shields were placed in the center of the table, each with 86 different garnishes, none of them identified, but all, we were promised, fitting accompaniments to the lamb. I cut the three tender servings into three smaller pieces so I could experience more of the flavor combinations, and the table turned into a guessing game as we each plucked the sides that tempted us and tried to identify what we'd chosen. Not every course was as unusual in its presentation as that. Some courses astonished with their perfection alone. Hot Potato, Cold Potato, which we were told was one of the oldest courses that still remained on the Alinea menu, consisted of a paraffin bowl filled with cold potato soup, while a hot potato and a piece of truffle were held aloft by a skewer which went through the lip of the bowl. We were to pull the pin, and the moment the two ingredients met, we were to toss it back, so the soup had no time to warm, the potato no time to chill, and the two flavors and temperatures only came together on the tongue. Then there was the Black Truffle Explosion, which was served on a spoon, and to be chewed with closed lips, so none of the delectable juice escaped. These awed not by the science fictional nature of their presentations, but from the precise combination of their ingredients, eaten at exactly the right moment. One course that makes clear why a dish must be eaten when served is the green apple helium balloon, which if not ingested upon delivery, would, I fear, end up collapsing upon itself before eaten. The skin of the balloon as well as the string with which we held it were both made of apply taffy, and we were told to press our lips against the balloon, take a bite, and inhale. My mouth filled immediately with the intense flavor of apple--and with helium as well, of course--so we were all soon talking about how amazing it tasted while sounding like Mickey and Minnie Mouse. For our final course, the table was cleared, and we were asked to lift our glasses as a silicone covering was rolled out. Servers then brought many small bowls, two metal jugs sweating with condensation, and three white globes with circular holes in their tops. Then two chefs arrived, and began spooning out the contents of the bowls onto the table, scattering them like culinary Jackson Pollacks as they identified each--freeze-dried strawberry, English pea, buttermilk cream, and so on. Then the chefs each lifted a jug and announced, \"liquid nitrogen,\" and poured the contents into the white globes, which caused a fog to rise and cover the table. Finally, the chefs lifted the globes, which were made of white chocolate, and smashed them upon the table, revealing the goodies within--meringues, cotton candy, miniature jelly donuts, condensed honeydew melon, and more. After which we took our spoons and attacked, not making as much of a dent as the creation deserved. At meal's end, we stepped out of the restaurant ... four hours and thirty-nine minutes after we had arrived. Yes. The meal took four hours and thirty-nine minutes. But I assure you that it did not feel as if that much time had passed, because ... oh, I'm going to go into cliche mode now, but you know how it's sometimes said that time stood still? Well, time didn't stand still, per se, but ... let's just say that while we were in Alinea, it didn't exist. We were outside of time, in a pocket universe all to ourselves.\\n  \\\n",

       " 'This spot is close to my job so I decided to check it out for lunch. The prices are just about what you would expect for Soho/\"South Village\" sit-down lunch prices; my meal came out to $20 for a mint lemonade and a decent-sized salad. I ordered what I think may have been a special, a roasted chicken & vegetable salad. The chicken was unbelievably dry, to the point where I had tough time chewing without choking a bit. It was served on a bed of arugula which could have chopped a little finer as it was in full, hard to eat pieces. When I eat a salad, I expect it to be cut down to make for easier bites. Not necessarily a chopped salad, just pieces that will actually fit in your mouth without chopping it up yourself. Basically, I don\\'t want to use a knife to eat a salad. However, service was friendly & quick and the restaurant itself was comfortable, albeit tiny. I would go back to try something else, but probably not for a salad.',\n",

Good thing my friend shared it with me; otherwise I think I would so bored eating only beets, and a few leaves of greens. -Classic Greek Avolemono, basically a very tangy chicken broth with orzo. My friend really likes it at this place. The place is small. There are only 6 tables, but they do delivery. Good service if you decide to dine in.',\n",

And we were hungry and decided to try this hole in a wall gem! \\xc2\\xa0Literally a hole in the wall which I think is perfect I believe they have 5 tables and it's so small the restroom is down the hall! The food is delicious...had the hummus, warm pita, lamb stew was fresh & just perfect, pastitsio (sp?) was perfect and portion were just enough! They dimmed the lights lit candles and it was a perfect way to end a Sunday...full tummy, wine, a real gem! The service is good hard not to be in such a small place!

They couldn't accommodate the three of us at first (it's tiny), but took my number and called us back like 15 mins later. Fresh ingredients and the flavors hit all the right notes. The pastitsio was delicate, the hummus was creamy and the dolmades werent too dense, or tart. Service was with a smile, too. Definitely good to try on a mellow Saturday afternoon.\",\n",

Well look no further, it's pine nuts. How did I not know this, add it to meatballs and you're in for a treat.

My favorite soup of all time, they rock here -- the Avgolemono is super lemony and perfect, with al dente orzo. Served with toasted slivers of olive oil coated fresh bread.

I loved the big orzo rice and the flavor was perfectly lemony and super delicious. The Chicken Artichoke salad was WOW! Its huge and there was a generous amount of roasted chicken and all of the other fresh and tasty toppings. My minor suggestion for the kitchen would be to cook the potatoes just a little more.

The skordalia was not fine and was more like soup than a dip. So watery and not authentic at all. The chicken souvlaki sandwich was ice cold. Like it was in a freezer.

The person working there opened the door and said they wouldn't be open for 10 minutes, which didn't seem like a big deal. Then she kept telling people it would be a few more minutes, until we were finally allowed in close to 12:05. I ordered the chicken sandwich and lemonade. When there was some confusion with whether we were paying together or separate, the same person who begrudgingly let us in expressed exasperation - she clearly wasn't having a good day. After we sorted the order, she told us to wait outside, in the heat - even though there were no other people in the place! The sandwiches were finally ready after 12:20. Snotty service, half an hour wait, $14 for a sandwich and a tiny lemonade... and the sandwich was cold, on a very tough roll and lacking flavor - I couldn't even finish it. Maybe I picked the wrong thing on the menu, but I won't be going back here. The Potbelly sandwich I had for $5.50 last night was much better.\",\n",

So I might be judging it more harshly because I expect it to be better given the effort to get there. Service is great. Everyone in the cozy restaurant is very friendly and helpful when it comes to suggestions of what to order. The place is probably best for a quiet lunch date as it is cramped. I definitely wouldn't come with a group of kids or girlfriends during a shopping excursion. I find the lamb sandwich incredibly overpriced (around $11) and definitely not worth it. It was pretty darn small and stingily filled. It has a lot of flavor while being flavorless. That is, I feel like the actual ingredients are kind of flavorless, the lamb, the vegetables, etc. but all the seasoning is an overpowering mishmash of tastes so you end up with something indistinct. The spanakopitakia are tiny little triangles of yummy, flaky, buttery, spinach-y goodness. They might be a little rich for some but I love them. Definitely great as an appetizer or as a light snack on their own. The baklava is good. Not spectacular but everyone has their own preferences when it comes to baklava. I find the layers a bit too dry and I wish the flavor was a little more nutty and less dependent on spices for taste. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll be back but it's a nice place to stop in if you're in the area. I will say that the times I've been in I've seen people ordering salads which looked delicious so maybe that's their specialty.\",\n",

The boyfriend had been eyeing the boneless lamb rib, but the server told him if he was hungry, it probably wouldn't be enough food. We also had baklava for dessert. The tzatziki was definitely five stars. Creamy, flavorful, and served with soft pita triangles fresh out of the oven. Even better, our waitress refilled our pita basket several times when we asked! The avgolemono was also really good and had lots of lemon to it, although I would have liked a bit more orzo and more than two bits of chicken in the whole bowl... Both my roommate and boyfriend loved the lamb stifado. The lamb was tender, perfectly seasoned, and the portion was generous. It also came with a delicious rice pilaf. The service was also very friendly, and you could tell our waitress knew the menu well. The only reason Snack doesn't get five stars is their baklava.

The waitress had to pull out the table, also very tiny in order for me to sit on the inside without disturbing the table next to us.

Every dish has a nice blend of fresh ingredients. 1. Tzatziki - Greek yogurt dip with crunchy shreds of cucumber, served with warm pita. 2. Spinach Pie - More like a thin triangular hot pocket than an actual pie, flakey crust, and the right amount of filling. 3. Greek Salad - It's still a salad, not much to say. 4.

My personal conspiracy theory is that they actually put some kind of a drug into it, like those Chinese ppl do, so you just HAVE to come back for more!!! The place itself is as small as it is cute. Perfect for a little get together with a long lost friend, but I would assume reservations are required for dinner hours... The staff is super cool, attentive and accommodating. Considering the fact that I am a very detail oriented person, I get so excited about eating there, that no matter how many times I go there ordering the same things, I always forget the name of their special Greek coffee, which apparently is a frapuccino and an iced one for that matter, haha. I wrote it down last time i was there and now they will finally have to stop making me that complimentary batch of my imaginary coffee.

It's easy to make a bad one because you don't have anything to hide behind -- and this kitchen failed on it. The prices are indeed low by the standards of quality restaurants in NYC, but they achieve those prices by skimping on expensive ingredients like meat and substituting large quantities of rice, potatoes and other starches to fill you up. If you like starches more than meat -- like most of the women I eat with -- that will be fine with you and you'll happily pocket the savings. If you're a meat lover, it's false economy.\",\n",

About 1/3 of the time I go, I'm so hungry that I end up getting my food to go and sitting on the bench outside or near the playground. The other reason I took away 1 star is because they keep using this blond waitress that was hired last summer or spring. She's the worst. The first time I noticed her, she got my order wrong and insisted that I had ordered what she thought I did, even though I order the same couple of items and what she insisted I ordered was not one of them. Then when our food finally came, she kept coming by and trying to take away the plates even though food was still on them and my friend was still eating. The table next to us also kept saying they weren't done with their food when she tried to take away their food.

Now as for the service coordination, while not poor, was a tad odd. \\xc2\\xa0Because the place is so small (very few tables, that\\'s fine), I asked for my sandwhich to be bagged up as \\'to go\\' (naturally, since I had to sit outside, fine with that), however, I really wanted to have a beer with the sandwhich; couldn\\'t do that, so I just ordered and waited for food to be bagged up. \\xc2\\xa0While waiting, two tables cleared (and were never re-seated during my entire stay) and I asked if I could be seated at the table, because a) I would prefer to eat inside and b) I would like to order a beer. \\xc2\\xa0To which I received this puzzling response (paraphrasing): \\'I\\'m sorry, you can\\'t have the table since they are already bagging your food\". \\xc2\\xa0Hmmm...so, I was willing to spend more money, but it was like the $10 minimum clock had been reset (which there is, definitely understand why with such a small place). \\xc2\\xa0So, I ate on the bench, original order, tables not filled and a further revenue stream from a customer stopped in it\\'s tracks. \\xc2\\xa0Oh well!

It came with a side of rice and lentils as well as a small plate of greens ($6 if you buy it on its own). Service was friendly; water refills were frequent. Alas, I was completely stuffed and had no room for dessert ($4 each).

Variable pricing annoys me, especially when it is exactly the same dish. Just because eggplant is a nightshade vegetable, doesn\\'t justify charging more for it after dark. It\\'s still great food BUT the value is just not there at almost $20. Service with a smile wasn\\'t included in that price either.

       " \"After a lengthy debate with my local hosts about where to dine for lunch, after ruling out a relatively local place known for it's Mediterranean style food and especially its lemon chicken orzo soup, it was settled that we'd go to a different spot because it had rockin' sandwiches. Along for the ride, I said, hey, why not? \\xc2\\xa0You're the boss. \\xc2\\xa0(A figure of speech. \\xc2\\xa0Literally.) So, imagine my confusion when we sit down and the first thing I see is a bunch of lamb entrees and a lemon chicken orzo soup. \\xc2\\xa0WTF?! \\xc2\\xa0I'm so confused. Well, it just so happens that this place Snack is an annex of some sort to the other place we were considering, even though no one knew it when we were debating. \\xc2\\xa0What are the odds? \\xc2\\xa0I mean, I'm in the biggest eating city in the world, and my two compatriots are essentially debating the merits of the same place??? The lamb sandwich was amazing. \\xc2\\xa0What is it about lamb in NYC right now? \\xc2\\xa0Two times in like 14 hours. \\xc2\\xa0And the soup was very refreshing and flavorful. This is a super cute little spot with seating for no more than about 15 people, so be prepared to wait if you're there during prime time. Oh, and the minty fresh lemonade hit the spot on this warm day, too. (OK, so Russ already told the story, but I like my version better. Ha.)\",\n",

       " \"Ever since I studied in Greece, I have always looked for a decent Greek place no matter where I happen to be traveling. Now that I live in NYC, I had been pretty disappointed in terms of finding a quick, tasty and legitimate Greek menu. Sure, you could go to Thalassa or the like to have a real sit-down meal, but what about the quick occasions that you need something hearty and fast? Greek usually perfectly fits the bill, but I hadn't had much luck in the city until this place. Cozy little space with a very legit Greek menu, with all the favorites: moussaka, souvlaki, spanikopita, baklava and even a couple of Greek beers (though no Mythos, my hands-down favorite). Went there 2 days in a row after I discovered it, and been pleased both times. I particularly recommend the garlic potato puree with pita and the warm chicken pie with mushrooms for lunch, and the deliciious eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin and bechemel sauce for dinner, though it is a special. The baklava serving size is HUGE and it is really very good, certainly comparable with some of the best homecooked stuff I've had. All in all, very dependable and authentic Greek cooking, reasonable prices, good service and good atmosphere. Certainly worth checking out, whether you need a quick snack while wandering SoHo or want to come out for a casual but romantic dinner.\",\n",

She brought me delicious free bread and joked with me throughout my meal. I received my pizza prompt and hot. It was fantastic. The ingredients played off each other in perfect harmony.

Since it was close to 11pm I was afraid they were getting ready to close but the owner of the place assured us it was alright, making us feel right at home. Though they were cleaning up not ONCE did they try and rush us. The waitress was super sweet and friendly, and the food came out quickly. We didn't get to try the bread since they were out but they did give us some free pieces of bruschette. This was heaven in my mouth! The bread was so warm and moist, garlicky goodness underneath a bed of delicious red onions and tomatoes. SOOOO GOOD! I also love Pasta Fagioli so I got a bowl. This wasn't as great...kind of bland. Think it needed a garlic clove and some salt but good nonetheless. Next came out my Penne Alla Vodka and my friend's Penne Alla Boscaiola. It was delicious! They give you a ton of food, and the flavor was on point. The peas really added to the whole dish. My friend's food was equally appetizing. I will say the prices are a wee bit higher than the average Italian spot but \\xc2\\xa0this place totally makes it worth it. After gobbling up what we could from our huge pasta plates, the owner chit chatted with us as they got ready to close and gave us some menus so we can order next time we were at work.

We ordered a large Margherita, and each component had a distinct and robust flavor. Not too sure how to feel about the ambiance. It was OK, but the opera music was a bit too dramatic for the restaurant, and the superimposed family pictures on the wall were too personal and intimate for my taste. The service was good.

Sure, there are pizza joints that are arguably better but unless the pie is made of solid platinum, I'm not standing in line for an hour or more to get it. At the end of the day, it's just pizza. I'd much prefer a pizza that's nearly as good (and Peppinos is nearly as good) that comes right to my door. Peppinos pies start with a subtle and slightly sweet tomato base, then layered with fresh mozzarella and adorned with your choice of toppings. The pies are cooked in a coal fired oven so you get that spectacular blackening of the crust on the bottom. It really is a top notch pizza. Is this my favorite pie? No, that honor goes to the Tartufata at Toby's. But this is, by far, the best delivery pie I've had in NYC.

They cook in a brick oven, and everything has the most amazing crust with a char. \\xc2\\xa0Our drinks arrived quickly, fresh bread was brought to the table. \\xc2\\xa0The bread was simple but amazing. \\xc2\\xa0We decided to split a Margherita pizza, a plain calzone and a meatball parmigiana roll. \\xc2\\xa0The pizza was absolutely delicous, the calzone was THE BEST I've ever tasted. \\xc2\\xa0The meatball parmigiana roll was very good, but the previous two items were outstanding. \\xc2\\xa0 The manager insisted upon making us a second pizza because there was \\xc2\\xa0a hole (we didn't see it) in the first pizza since the center was too thin. \\xc2\\xa0We said it wasn't necessary but he insisted, so we had another pizza to take with us and we left a great tip for our server. I'm nosy so I had to ask the table next to us what they'd ordered, their pizza had prosciutto and mushrooms and they were raving about it. \\xc2\\xa0Definitely worth the money, great food, great service, good prices. \\xc2\\xa0Business is booming too, there were tons of carry out and delivery orders leaving. \\xc2\\xa0 I can't wait for my next trip to New York, a meal at Peppino's will definitely be on our itinerary!\",\n",

Delivery was quick. So they did great on the service side. Now on the food side, the bruschette was tasty. The mozzarella and tomato was ok. The mozzarella was not very fresh. The marinara pizza was very bland. The sauce lacked flavors. Overall the pizza was quite tasteless. The veggie pie pizza was better. It was loaded with a lot of chunky vegetables.

It was a BEAUTIFUL pizza. Probably about 10 inches wide, with 4 slices. All of the ingredients high quality, and the crust with the right amount of char. I never used to understand why having a little bit of a blackened edge is a good thing. If your pizza has tons of tasty toppings, the blackened part helps to clean your palate a little bit between slices. Otherwise, the flavors(and oils) build up in your mouth until it just doesn\\'t feel right anymore.

Two things bother me for which they lost a couple of stars (it'd be 1.5 stars if this was an option). Firstly, we ordered a Diavola pizza and it was not good. Not bad, just not good. Too much tomato not enough cheese and sausage. It might have been an off day. Secondly, and more importantly, it is expensive. I just don't think a pizza should ever cost $25 once you add the tax.

We went there, honestly, because it was chilly and we were too lazy to go out to Di Fara. \\xc2\\xa0We wanted pizza, but something good - not the normal crap that passes for a pie in the Slope. \\xc2\\xa0When we decided against Di Fara, my next thought was Franny's - where else? \\xc2\\xa0But that would've still ended up being a hike for us, and so we figured, no something closer. We had passed Peppino's several times and it looked inviting, but the prices were a bit off-putting - $17 for a margherita pie isn't outrageous for brick oven, but we've got kids, and these days every buck counts. \\xc2\\xa0Still, we wanted something better than the usual fare, so we headed on down. We ordered a margherita but asked for some ricotta on it, and the mozzarella and tomato plate to start. \\xc2\\xa0The mozzarella and tomato plate was uninspiring, fairly normal, but that's not a bad thing. The pizza itself was quite good - and surprisingly large. \\xc2\\xa0Most of these brick oven places charge you twice what a normal pie runs and gives you something around the size of a frisbee and expect you to be blown away. \\xc2\\xa0(Franny's is guilty of this, for instance, although the obvious art and effort that goes into their pies mostly makes up for it.) \\xc2\\xa0This one, though, was full sized - and made with fresh mozzarella and herbed ricotta. \\xc2\\xa0For that price, it was excellent. \\xc2\\xa0The sauce was the best part - one of the best pizza sauces we've had in a while. \\xc2\\xa0The crust was crisp on the edges, soft on the inside, firm and thick enough to hold the pizza together but not so thick that you feel like you're eating a piece of bread with sauce and cheese on top. \\xc2\\xa0The only real downside was that there was actually too much cheese - we wish we had asked for extra sauce, or maybe a small cup of it on the side to dip into. The waiter also brought out - gratis - a mini pie, half margherita, half calzone, for us to try. \\xc2\\xa0I'm not quite sure why - maybe because we had asked for ricotta on our pie, which is basically a different incarnation of the pie we got. \\xc2\\xa0We weren't objecting. The service was a little distracted but very friendly, and very tolerant of our girls, who were feeling especially rambunctious. \\xc2\\xa0They have kids drawings taped all over one of the walls, and everyone was smiling as they worked. \\xc2\\xa0The decor was a little off - I think they weren't quite sure if they were upscale brick oven, local neighborhood joint, family-run establishment... it looked like a mix of all of the above. Overall, I'd recommend them pretty highly. \\xc2\\xa0The prices were very affordable, and the pies very satisfying. \\xc2\\xa0They aren't the best in the world, but in Park Slope? \\xc2\\xa0Pretty close to it.\",\n",

Dough is homemade, chewy, with a nice crispiness to the crust (obviously, it suffers a little in delivery, as all high-end pizza does. We ask for ours well-done when delivering). Most sandwiches come on bread made from the same dough as the pizza. Sauce is flavorful, chunky, well-spiced, and not at all sweet, which I hate. Cheese is very good, with actual flavor, as opposed to the rubbery fatwads lots of pizza places use. Toppings are high-quality, and they don't skimp. Is this the best pizza in New York? No. Is it the best pizza in Park Slope? Definitely. I hope you agree: just don't be sitting in my seat when I get there. : )\",\n",

Original review~~~~~~~~~ I ordered food for delivery for a second time to see if the other items were as good as the first time I ordered. I used Seamless to make the ordering easier, and that turned out not to be the case. I ordered the Banana Polenta Fries which are $8. I got a call from the restaurant shortly after placing my order, informing me that they were out of that and asked what I would like to replace it with. I asked \\xc2\\xa0what else they had for the same price, and was told lots of items that were less, but nothing for the same price or even more. Finally I was told that the bread pudding was the same price, so that is what I ordered. Turned out, it was actually $3 cheaper, but my order was never revised and I was charged the more expensive price. When something like that happens at other restaurants, they normally offer an item that is the same $ or more. Never, and I mean NEVER, have I been offered food that is less $, and then charged for the pricier item. That alone is bad business practice. unfortunately that is not the only bad part of the order. The delivery guy called me from outside my building telling me to come down and get my food because he has a bike. Don't most food delivery guys ride bikes?Aren't they suppose to deliver food to the door, and not ask you to go outside to get your food because they have a bike? I'm upset about both items above, but charging me more $ for a cheaper item is extremely bad business.\",\n",

But the food is the only thing that comes out in a timely fashion. In a virtually empty restaurant, the staff is scattered about making no attempts to look busy, and if you order a drink, alcoholic or not, you won't get it for at least twenty minutes, and if you order multiple drinks (ie: coffee and water and a house made beverage) you'll get them each ten minutes apart. The service is always with a smile, but I can't tell if any member of the staff has any sense of what is going on or what exactly defines his/her job. This place needs stronger management and a better trained and hospitably aware staff to give it that little push that it really needs. Tremendous potential here... Excellent menu, atmosphere is fantastic, the decor is interesting and reclaimed and perfect, but seriously lacking attention to detail in all aspects of service.\",\n",

The front room is what sells you: open and airy, big communal dining table, well kept bar. It feels very welcoming, like a European cafe. The main seating area is a bit drab since it\\'s in the back of the restaurant with much less natural light. The service was average at best. The bartender glanced at us when we walked in and then ignored us until the servers reappeared. They were training a waitress when we visited, which is fine, but neither the trainer nor the trainee had much gusto and when I asked what the happy hour wine was they both seemed totally thrown for an answer beyond there being a \"red\" and a \"white\". Which brings me to the food, which was probably the biggest let down. The happy hour is a bit lame, $1 off two house wines and their beers, none of which I was terribly interested in. We came for dinner and ordered the gnocchi and the veggie burger. The gnocchi is a significantly smaller portion than other entrees and the flavors were confused and bland. There was what appeared to be deli mustard in the gnocchi sauce, which in addition to the gigantic slab of tough and chewy mushroom on the plate, was really not working. The veggie burger was gray, mushy, and flavorless. They also have no mayonnaise, which the burger really could have used and is in general just a little weird right? I would maybe give it another try for a drink or small bite, mostly just because sitting at the front communal table seems like it would be pleasant.

Many of the reviews here convinced me to visit right away, but I left feeling pretty disappointed. My date and I ordered the Asparagus Terrine, Gnocchi appetizer, french fries, and Lamb Tatsoi w/ apricot. The ingredients were definitely fresh, but needed a lot more seasoning. Overall the meal tasted very bland and we had to rely on the black pepper to liven up the dishes a bit. I understand that it\\'s good to use salt sparingly, but the lack thereof really made these dishes extremely underwhelming. If this was the bland Midwest, I would have understood the lack of spices and flavor, but not NYC of all places. Also, from the pictures that I saw here on Yelp, the lamb dish used to come with brussel sprouts and parsney chips... Other times kale and a ragu. What I had last night was braised (more like pulled lamb) on a bed of fresh spinach with ONLY ONE pickled onion and a dab of apricot puree. Pretty boring. The server was nice and pretty helpful, but there was a guy playing the most annoying things on the piano before finally getting into \"enjoyable\" melodies 45 minutes into whatever practice session he was on. Not entirely sold on this place. I feel like this type of cuisine might be better appreciated by others, but just didn\\'t do it for me or date at all.',\n",

       " \"A new entry to a rapidly changing area of BedStuy, this restaurant is a patchwork of diverse materials and artifacts rescued from many locations around NYC. Interesting, unique decor. The service is friendly, the waitress was cheerful, warm, and very welcoming. The food was delicious, with generous portions of fries with my meal (I ordered the veggie sandwich with a slice of lamb on it). I had to knock one star off for the small menu selection. Hopefully the menu will grow and offer more items, but for now it's very limited. Also, they could do better with the lighting, especially in the table areas towards the rear. The lighting was a tad too dim and kind of depressing. Some warmer glows would help the ambiance alot. Overall, a nice place to go to when you're in the area and a welcome addition to the neighborhood.\",\n",
       " \"Adorable, chill place w live reggae band saturday night. Service was good though we went when it was pretty empty. Though menu was somewhat limited and a lil' pricey, both entrees were tasty. They were helpful in recommending and accommodating to my food intolerance/sensitivity. 1. Veggie burger w leeks and pickled onion jam 2. Gnocchi w mushroom\",\n",

       " \"So I have a bunch to say about this place...but first a disclaimer: as a native Brooklynite I have been exposed to so many restaurants come and go in this borough, I realize that I have become a bit of an elitist foodie (but only for Brooklyn dining). So please take my comments with a grain of salt: 1. The food really is good. We had the Parmesan sticks that we more like knishes without potato; the gnocchi, and the monk fish. Solid dishes! 2. The ambiance is real chill, filled with refurbished wood, steel windows from an asylum, and parquet floors. 3. But the service is a hot mess!!! The menu is not clearly divided up into apps/ small plates and entrees- you have to infer this info in the price; waitresses aren't able to speak to items on the menu in order to make recommendations; food is not timed to come out at the right times, so you are eating at the same time as your friends; way too many people work in the space and they just all step over each other and interrupt your dinner. It's a good space and I wish them luck, but I don't plan to go back until a few months pass and they figure their shit out- especially for the price they are asking you to pay for their carelessness.\",\n",
       " \"Very good food. Very creative and fresh. I had the veggie burger with lamb (definitely get it with the lamb if you are not vegetarian), and the Fianc\\xc3\\xa9 had the gnocchi. Gnocchi is definitely hand made and very rustic in taste. Sadly had to knock off 2 stars because of service. Don't get me wrong, everyone is VERY nice, but they all appear to be novices in the service industry. Waitress actually took my order and then ran off, forgetting to take my date's order along with mine. They just need to tone up their service skills a little and run a tighter ship. They should start with the pacing of food. Our food came out in 5 minutes. We barely had time to sip our first drinks, and as a result, did not feel the need to order a 2nd round. Generally a very nervous and confused energy coming from the wait staff. My wish for this place is that they become cool and suave with their service, making me feel like I want to spend $20 on an entree and sit and drink for awhile. It seems they are trying to be a fine dining experience in Bedtsuy, and they have the food and decor to back it up, but not the service skills.\",\n",
       " \"Absolutely die for this spot. Had the pleasure of sharing drinks with Mark (owner/consultant) on several occasions. I wandered in off the street on my first visit and felt transported to a Caribbean dream. The entire restaurant was decorated by Mark, himself, and contains pieces over a century old. Great music, people and oh yes, the food! Words won't do justice, you must go and order the menu for yourself. Live reggae, home made syrups and sodas and a backyard garden. This restaurant epitomizes why Brooklyn is the epicenter of our culture today. Go to Dekalb and feel at home in a place right out of a destination. Cheers.\",\n",

Eggs Benedict was overcooked...the eggs weren't runny at all, so if I went again I would specify. The blackened scramble was lamb instead of fish but the scallions were a little too powerful. Also, the food didn't come out all at the same time. But it was all plated attractively. The drinks were good and the live music was great! They were also really careful about food allergies and extremely accomodating. Atmosphere was great and so was the service. Would like to go for dinner.\",\n",

       " \"Dekalb Restaurant is a neighbourhood gem that hits all the right notes: great community spirit, lovely refurbished atmosphere, an incredibly friendly staff who all take the time to get to know you, and amazing food. In an era which is increasingly hands-off, it's nice to know that there's still pockets of community like this restaurant. We've been here for both dinner and brunch, and both times the food has been supremely outstanding. Dekalb specializes in the veg options, though there are still options for us meat-eaters (oh, how the tables have turned!). Prices are low, and though the portions are reflective of the cost, they're not absurdly Lilliputian like it can be in Manhattan. The best part, especially for someone that doesn't drink all that much, is that they have creative non-boozy -- the Bluestone (their take on a virgin Bloody Mary) is damned good for brunch, while the Brozost (lemon, thyme, and sparkling water) is a bubbly treat you need to have asap. As I've mentioned before, service is incredibly friendly. They are very much aware of the ingredients in their dishes, which is great since one of us does come with a strange food allergy. Don't expect to be rushed into decisions or eating by the service -- Dekalb lets you linger from beginning to end, all with smiles and thanks at the end of the meal. It's no wonder we're very excited that this place is only a few blocks away for dinner and weekend brunch, and I expect it'll be one of our neighbourhood staples shortly.\",\n",
       " 'I stopped in here yesterday & I was transported to a Euro vibe oasis. Mark was behind the bar and he is definitely quite the apothecary. Like my fellow reviewers mentioned, I was not rushed and was in fact welcomed like a member of the family. All the workers are local and care about the future of Brooklyn. They have a garden that will house their own home grown produce, which is AWESOME. The restaurant is made of old salvaged architecture and its definitely worth a snap or two. While dining I also met Ras and Stefan who are also a breath of fresh air from your typical restaurant owners. They also plan on having live music on Saturday and Sundays. Check it out, I feel there is more to come from Dakalb Restaurant',\n",

Friendly, sociable and genuinely excited about what he's doing! \\xc2\\xa0We only came in for a cocktail, and stayed for a few more than that. As a bartender, I appreciate the small but well selected liquor selection. Mark knows his products and you can tell he selected each one of them for a specific reason. The lamb looks amazing! I'll have to get it next time. In terms of the space, it's absolutely beautiful! I love it here!\",\n",
       " 'After hearing so many good things about this spot , I decided to take my girlfriend to Dekalb Restaurant for brunch. Needless to say the food was amazing! Due to the fact that Dekalb Restaurant opened in January of this year, there is still a bit of menu restructurin. There were not too many dishes to pick from the brunch menu, however, each dish is outstanding. The polenta banana porridge is crazy good. Just a hint of banana that is brought out with The side muesli, and a nice savory edge with the egg and bacon side platter. The blackened rocky scramble also excites the taste-buds and is well balanced Loved the service and the whole feel of the establishment. Decor is very nice indeed. Highly recommended for all. It is also a family friendly establishment !!',\n",

I had the privilege of dining there Friday night with some friends and from the moment I walked in the door I felt at home. Our server, Jaime, had extensive menu knowledge and was attentive without being overbearing. I had the mushroom ravioli and tried the lamb, the ravioli was a perfect blend of flavors and the lamb was juicy and tender enough to eat with only a fork. My party and I were graced with the company of two of the owners, Mark and Ras. While Mark told us jokes we were treated to a musical performance by Ras. This is a man full of soul who channels it through his acoustic guitar. I plan to be a regular here, at what will hopefully be a longstanding staple in Brooklyn.\",\n",

Eat here, I promise you will love the food!',\n",
       " \"Truly disappointing. Like The Runner, Dekalb Restaurant devises a rustic menu with eclectic ingredients but fails the average taste test. Whoever made the veggie burger should be hog-tied and forced fed that uninspired mush. I'm not expecting Alice Waters by any means. The poorly executed farm to table concept leaves me craving a good old slice. \\xc2\\xa0They need to reinvent their menu, rethink their uneven portions and lackluster flavored food, hire a writer, and get rid of the low seats.\",\n",

When I was on my way there, as I walked by it I thought, \"wow, that place looks so cool, I want to go there\" before realizing that\\'s where I was meeting my date. Even the bathrooms are mad pretty. My vegetarian date and I (it\\'s a nice date spot) ordered like 4 things and split. I will try to remember what they were, although they all had a laundry list of exotic ingredients. Butternut squash tater tots (yummy although a bit greasy and fell apart....but like I said, yummy); parsnip gnocchi (GET THIS); kohlrabi kimchi melt sandwich (reminded me of banh mi); veggie burger. The portions are all smallish in size, but when we finished our meal we were full as heck. And trust, we ate it all because it was delicious. The service was so friendly and excellent! Once they get their liquor license and the bar in the front is in action, I think this place is really going to take off. You should go there before it\\'s hip so you can say you already knew about it. It\\'s a quick walk from the G. I have warm and fuzzy feelings about it.',\n",

Couple of tips - the entrees aren't that big compared to the appetisers, so consider treating \\xc2\\xa0it like tapas and go for lots of appetisers or order appetisers with your entree.

       " \"Came here for a double date on a Saturday night. We had reservations for 6pm but we came a little earlier. We were greeted by a friendly host who sat us right away. We were surprised that the place was practically empty, however, that did not last long. In no time it was filled with people. It's a really cute, small restaurant that has a classic feel to it. There is a large selection of wine. They do not do cocktails but there is always wine! =D The prices were reasonable for good food, especially in the city. We started off with some delicious appetizers. We had the mussels in garlic and white wine sauce, yum! I do not usually like mussels but these were so good. The sauce was great. My friend and I split the baby spinach salad with goat cheese, almonds, tomatoes and some special sauce which was so fresh and light. For my entree I had the salmon. My friends had the pork, calf liver (YUM!) and the bistro steak. Everything was so delicious, we loved it all! So flavorful, fresh and amazing! Dessert followed, as if we didnt eat enough =x I had the creme brulee (YESSSSSSSS!!!!!) my friends had the apple tart and the floating island. Once again everything was great. Overall, we were really impressed and satisfied with the services, the food, and the atmosphere. Def recommend it. Will have to come back for the brunch special.\",\n",
       " \"I don't believe they do cocktails, I saw nothing but wine behind the bar. I did however have a nice glass of dry Chardonnay that was recommended by the waiter. The bread was kind of burnt and hard and the butter was too cold. The endive salad is literally the best thing I've had in awhile; roasted pears, Roquefort cheese, walnut, port vinaigrette... I almost ordered another one.The Escargots with herbs and garlic butter was good as well. I got the atlantic salmon with baby vegetable risotto and saffron sauce upon recommendation over the steak. The salmon was cooked perfectly as was the rice, however the vegetables were overdone and the sauce very nearly ruined the dish. It had this strange thick orange component, I couldn't really taste the saffron at all, I tried to scrap most of it off. Wish I'd gotten a different entree. Los profiteroles for dessert was solid, the chocolate was the right consistency as was the cream to puff ratio. Good experience, pricey though.\",\n",

Went on a Sunday night around 8 pm and we were greeted by an INCREDIBLY rude host who came over to us and said, \"Yes?\" Errr. WHAT?! Excuse me, but you do NOT greet your customers that way. Then he asked us whether we had a reservation, and we said no. He told us the wait would be 30 minutes and ignored us, before we even said we wanted to wait. My girlfriend was so pissed we immediately walked out. How ridiculously rude. I will never support an establishment like this. No one deserves to be treated like this.',\n",

Omelette's were simple and scrumptious. Croquette with ham and cheese on brioche was very soft and flavorful. My smoked salmon eggs Benedict was delicious.

First off, it\\'s situated in a quiet part of the city - accessible by the 6 train. We ordered the mussels and the salmon. The salmon was cooked SO perfectly. I gobbled that fish up. It was on top of this really flavorful risotto with vegetables. That risotto was gone in seconds. The mussels itself were good (but not out of this world) but that sauce was ah-mazing! We kept requesting bread so we could mop that up! Deeelish. The average cost for an entree is about $20 so it is a bit expensive but it is French food after all.

Their house bordeux has a sweet finish which i am not accustomed to so i stuck with the malbec. Started with escargot and it tasted so good, it was drenched in butter. The smell from the next table made me order it and subsequently the smell from my order made the next table order it too! Take the bread and dip it in that escargot butter, it is amazing. I ordered the steak frites and the french onion soup. This is by far the best french onion soup i have ever had. the soup was salted and flavorful but not too salty and the onions were stewed to perfection, it wasn't super soggy from sitting on the stove way too long. it was so good, id go back just for the soup. the steak tasted stewed and ab it tough for medium but it was covered in the best wine sauce and the fries to go with it was just amazing. extra crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I arrived 40 minutes earlier than my reservation and the staff was so nice to me, they even let me sit down first and munch on bread til the rest of the party arrived and was patient to explain dishes to me.

However, there were a few problems with the service, which we weren\\'t too pleased about, primarily because this is a small and crowded restaurant: When we ordered, we were told that we couldn\\'t change anything on the menu, even if it was due to an allergy especially because it was so crowded. When we were all done eating except for one girl in our group, \\xc2\\xa0the staff \\xc2\\xa0kept coming over to ask if she was done eating and got more aggressive about it over time.

The food was phenomenal. There was a lot of salmon. The poached eggs were just the right amount of runny. I really enjoyed my dish. Plus it comes with fries and salad (both average, but average is good!) Very pleased with the entree, and extremely filling. I'll definitely come back again.

We came at 12pm on Saturday and had no issues for two people -the lighting is a bit dark for my liking (especially if you sit more inside).

       " 'Cutest little french bistro in murray hill (of all the places!). We walked in on a busy Thursday night (after being quoted a 1.5 hour long wait at Cask next door) and were able to score a table immediately. I loved their wine carafes which were moderately priced and much less intimidating than ordering a whole bottle. Food was phenomenal. Literally everything we ordered was delicious to the last bite. But whether you get anything else or not, you must must must order the escargot. Holy moly.. I think I licked every snail shell clean! YUM!',\n",
       " \"Had the duck liver pate and was disappointed. It was dry and just was not full of the taste that one would expect. Persons in my party complained about the steak being tough. Had the duck confit which was ok. Don't think the restaurant deserves the 4 star rating it has on Yelp\",\n",
       " \"My go to brunch for my neighborhood. Having discovered this magical place after being told of a 2 hour wait at Penelope, Le Parisien seated my friend and I no problem, and even gave us free mimosa refills since it was near the end of brunch hours. They have all the typical standard brunch foods but no place nearby can beat their French fries, these thin sticks of potato is fried to perfection. I'm sad to see the grilled portobello mushroom pesto sandwich off their brunch menu, but I did get to enjoy their amazing smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Hmmmmm yolkporn as my friend likes to call it. It was just what we needed. The place is small and quaint, so I'd advise to come early for brunches. I can't wait to go and try their dinner menu, everything just sounds so delicious.\",\n",
       " \"BRUNCH! Scrumptious, heavenly, all that is right in world with this new amazing spot I have just discovered! I have nothing but amazing things to say about this quaint gem! No reservations taken, but my brunch date and I walked in around 12:15 to find only 4 tables taken, but by the time we had gotten our drinks, and ordered, the place was packed. Things to Note As Pertaining to Ambiance: 1. Place is small, so if you want a table, come with a small party, 2-4 people, no bigger. If you are looking to bring a bigger party, pick another place, ideally speaking, or get there at 12 SHARP! 2. Even if you are a party of 2, still get there before 12:30 if you want to secure a table (they open at 12 for brunch). 3. Very intimate setting, you will hear the conversation next to you and a few other conversations in the area, and if you are claustrophobic I would avoid it as well. 4. The place itself, as I said, earlier is a quaint little spot in midtown, but secluded enough to miss the busy rush of the city feel. A little getaway, if you will. OKAY ON TO THE FOOD - Free brunch drink if you order an entree. We ordered the Sangria, which was good, although it was hard to eat the fruit because the oranges still had peels on them, which would be my only complaint. I would love this place EVEN more if they had a boozy brunch.... ALAS! I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict with Ham and Hollandaise sauce and my brunch date ordered the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax on English Muffins with Hollandaise sauce. We both, MULTIPLE TIMES, commented on how the eggs benedict, and salmon poached eggs just melted in our mouths, and dare I say it, THE BEST EGGS BENEDICT WE HAD EVER HAD! YES YES YES YES YES! IT WAS HEAVENLY and neither of us wanted it to end. And of course because we are both fat asses in our own right, we ordered the Fluffy French Toast with warm vanilla maple syrup with apple compote (which also ended up having bananas) - WHICH WAS FABULOUS, but as it was slightly burnt on one of the sides, and could have been slightly fluffier, but still really really delicious, I'm gonna -1/2 star for that. The service was great throughout the meal, helpful, yet unobtrusive, but I just thought the tables were a little tight and hard to maneuver around, even to get out of the booth, the whole table needed to be moved -1/2 star for little to no room, just felt cramped, esp after they seated someone basically so close to us that I could almost touch shoulders to the person on my left and right. Overall though great experience, and definitely come for the EGGS BENEDICT! Such a fan of this place, that I am putting it on my list to try for lunch and dinner sometime soon! TOTAL WIN!\",\n",
       " \"Really cute and intimate spot. A friend and I had dinner early here (6pm) and were lucky to get the table by the front window so we weren't crammed in tight next to other tables. It got packed around 7or so and though the wait staff was friendly, I felt rushed. It's really small so the volume gets pretty loud and not really a place where you can sit for awhile to catch up with friends. We split the artichoke salad as an appetizer which was really nice - greens with warm roasted artichoke, cherry tomatoes in a lemony vinaigrette. Nice and refreshing. I had the special of the day - cod with cauliflower emulsion sauce and a side salad of roasted cauliflower. The cod was cooked very well but the sauce was a bit too thick and rich for me. The side salad was also salty. I tried a piece of my friend's skate and it was tasty. We split the apple tart with ice cream for dessert and it was just OK. Good that it was not too sweet but I was expecting more of a crust and it looked like it was just baked apples with some glaze on top.\",\n",
       " 'food is pretty good. very hole in the wall place. my friend got the mussels and says it was amazing and he got double the amount of mussels he usually gets. so it was a lot of mussels.

We had a wonderful meal of moules marini\\xc3\\xa8re, steak frites, and tarte tatin. Very intimate setting with great decor and all the atmosphere of Paris on East 33rd. The only downside is that you can't eat outside and people watch.\",\n",

It\\'s not fancy, or pretentious... but it\\'s obvious that this is where people come to indulge in fine French cuisine and libation. We shared a 1/2 carafe of 2012 red from Cotes du Rhone. Dry and delish. The ambiance is very low key and relaxed. (Just what you want when you\\'ve been married to someone for 7 years!) The menu was spectacular. Escargot cooked in parsley, garlic... and butter... if I could only order one thing from this place, it would be that and the crusty bread that accompanies it. For our main courses, we had the pan roasted chicken and the duck confit. The mushrooms and sauce on both these dishes were so good and flavorful! We had to be tacky and try the fries... I mean it\\'s internationally known as the \"French\" fry... and they were so light and crispy and salty and downright tasty! Then we had to compromise on the dessert... Profiteroles with ice cream or the \"Floating Island\" (Meringue sitting afloat on vanilla bean custard.) My hubs wanted the Profiteroles and I wanted the Floating Island... but being our anniversary and my husband usually letting me have the dessert I want every other time we go out to eat during the year... I... ahem... I mean, \"we\" agreed on the Profiteroles... :) Surprisingly the waitress came out with both! She said, \"The Floating Island is on the house, Happy Anniversary.\" Her name was, Ana, and she was such a sweet waitress throughout the entire meal... we were honored to be served by her... and I was personally happy that she eavesdropped on our lil dessert debacle. :) Both desserts were good, but I was partial to the Floating Island because of the textures and full vanilla bean flavor that they seemed to just \"pop\" in your mouth... it was also a little sweeter since it was an anniversary gift from them. ;)',\n",

There's not a lot of room here, and it would be difficult to get more than a group of 4 in here. It gets reasonably busy on the weekend, but not so much that there's a long line. The interior is decorated with vintage French posters and ceiling fans that give off a nice vibe. On nice days they open up the front so it's almost like dining in a patio, but be warned there is no air conditioning. They have a really nice brunch menu - most of the options are fixed price, and come with a entree and your choice of mimosa, OJ, sangria, or coffee (if I remember correctly additional glasses were 5$). The eggs benedict I had was delicious, and everyone else's dishes looked delicious too - the omelettes were plump but the salmon benedict really stole the show. Service is a little slow since it seems like they only have one waitress and one cook, but it makes for a nice leisurely brunch. Great, cozy restaurant with a very nice vibe!\",\n",

For entrees we opted for the liver (with an excellent wine reduction) that was cooked just right and juicy. My wife had the chicken which was also great. We both also had desserts.

Beef tartare- was amazing!! Seasoned on point! Steak frites-was so awesome, sauce was good. I asked for rare and guess what..i recieve my rare steak...

I like that you can make the reservations over Yelp. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny, yet they manage to fit a lot of people in it. This leads to some of the areas being very crowded, we originally were seated elbow to elbow with another couple, but the hostess asked us to move to make room for another party. While this was a tad annoying, it put us in a more spacious corner table. The decor is a lot of posters and pictures framed, once again the walls look crowded, I'm sure they could make the room look bigger with different paint, but they have tried with some huge mirrors that I liked. The vibe it gives off is more traditional than trendy. The dining room was a little bit loud, but not roaring or anything. We chose this place because the food was a bit cheaper, but still a nice restaraunt. I had the duck, and my fiance had the steak. I loved my duck, it was flavorful, tender, and the mushrooms and potatoes that came with it were delicious too. I hated the salad though. I only wish the piece of duck was bigger, like most places serve it. The steak seemed to be more about the marinade/sauce as opposed to a really nice steak. It was still tender, and it definitely was flavorful. Overall that was nothing amazing. The fries were nice and thin and crispy though. I wish that the dessert menu was more extensive, it had four things on it. We had to google the names of all of them. We ended up having something that was like a cream puff but with icecream. We loved it with the warm fudge. There was two puffs so enough for both of us. The reason it gets four stars instead of five is because of the small space, decor, mediocre steak, and the fact that our server rarely came back. There was only three people on staff, so I get it.

I mean there's no one in the restaurant. Is that necessary? We asked for bread and he would take it out of a big bag with his bare hands - some gloves would have been nice. To start, I had the broccoli soup which was a seasonal special and it came with truffle oil and wild mushrooms. Aside from the truffle flavor which I liked, the rest of the soup was really bland. I tried my brother's roasted beet salad and thought it was very tasty. For my entr\\xc3\\xa9e, I had the skate which was decent but the butter lemon sauce was super heavy and creamy. My dad ordered the steak frites and he really wanted it grilled like how they do it in France. However, this was more of like a stew the way it was cooked. My brother enjoyed his grilled portobello sandwich. Overall, I would say while the food was decent, I don't think I would return since it's extremely cramped and nothing spectacular.\",\n",
       " \"Finally made it here for dinner and I left disappointed. It's one thing to be in a cramped loud place for brunch, but it's a whole other story for dinner. My boyfriend and I were thisclose to the two tables next to us and it was loud and just kind of disjointed. I didn't feel relaxed during the meal and didn't feel like we really had the chance to catch up. Bummer! The food itself was just okay. I got the grilled artichoke salad and the steak tartar and my boyfriend got the French onion soup and the duck. The artichoke salad had a weird taste to it that I can't place and definitely didn't like. The artichokes themselves were yummy though. The steak tartar was eh. Maybe I just don't like steak tartar? I haven't ordered it in awhile. I tried the duck and that was really good. Should have gotten that. The wine was also good. All in all, I definitely won't be coming back here for dinner. Possibly brunch again, but only if its convenient. Sounds like they raised their prices on that too!\",\n",

Live on 55th and Lex, hopped on and off the subway and wandered until we found this little treasure. He got poached eggs with salmon. I got the eggs Florentine. Both came with a spinach salad and french (ha) fries. The fries were perfect. The rest was pleasant. The mimosa was short and sweet. We came right at noon when we were the only people there. Within minutes the entire place was bustling with folks. Friendly staff. Clean bathroom. Food came quickly.',\n",

Excellent egg dishes (florentine, omelette) and croque monsieur. \\xc2\\xa0Dinner is your standard bistro fare done well. French onion soup, mussels, steak frites, duck confit are all quiet winners that leave you happy. Feel free to complement that with an extensive wine list which is also very reasonably priced.

Both were pretty good but not exceptional. The duck was a little dry and the steak was not very tender but both entrees were dressed well with a delicious sauce to compliment the meats.

Everything was wonderful, nothing too fancy, simply well cooked french food. We also ordered a carafe of bordeaux which was excellent. As my girlfriend and I sipped our wines, surrounded by walls plastered with vintage french posters, and listened to the waiters and waitresses speaking french in the background, it almost felt like we were spending our Valentine\\'s day in Paris... if it weren\\'t for some members of the staff asking \"FINISHED? FINISHED? FINISHED?\" every five minutes. I understand that it was Valentine\\'s Day and they are very busy, but that is why I made a reservation.

       " \"Le Parisien is the perfect little French cafe in a very American city. The place was small and quaint, with dim romantic lighting. The staff was very authentic in their French-ness, without exhibiting any of that infamous French attitude. I wouldn't even be able to blame them if they did, since my friend hadn't shown up till 20 minutes past our reservation. Now, when I say small, I mean you have to be prepared to share very intimate seating. The cramped space might have even added to the authenticity of the place. I like to think that perhaps the seating was designed with consideration of the slender and poised figures of the French, and not so much of the husky-bodied American. Regardless, you might have to shift your table around to get in and out, so it might be a good idea to use the restroom prior to getting situated. As for the food, it was DELICIOUS. My friend ordered the French Onion Soup and said it was a little bland, but that was her only complaint. She ordered the classic roasted chicken while i ordered the mussels with chorizo. Both were very delicious. I ended up forcing myself to physically consume the entirety of my dish even though it was huge. My body ached as i continued to eat past my limit, but i had no choice... my mouth overpowered my instinct, demanding i continue. I even went as far as soaking a few pieces of crusty brad into the broth of my mussels. Overall, my experience was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back for more.\",\n",

This bistro has a charming quality to it: quaint enough to let it be a date night without giving the impression of \"trying too hard.\" The seating area is pretty small, especially since one end of it is wall-to-wall glass. You may rub elbows with the party next to you. We tried the Bistrot Steak Frites with Red Wine Thyme Sauce with Shallots and the Duck Confit with Crispy Potatoes, Wild Mushrooms and Frisee Salad. Both dishes were delicious and components fresh. Steak was cooked perfectly and the duck confit was tender and flavorful. Overall, a pleasant surprise in terms of food and ambiance.',\n",

I ordered one of the nights specials - coq au vin - it was superb! Also a big plate; I ate until I just couldn't anymore. A very quaint restaurant. Get a reservation as there are not a lot of seats.

Best egg white omelettes!

Instead, I had it with a mixed green salad (which was standard spring mix with whatever dressing they use.... But for some reason it was also really really good). It must have been the sauce.

       " 'I love this place! \\xc2\\xa0It is small and quaint and so authentic. \\xc2\\xa0I spent years living in France and am always looking for places that have that je ne sais quoi (ugh, I know...) and Le Parisien has it. \\xc2\\xa0We went there for dinner on a Friday and got a table by the window before the place filled up (and it fills up quickly!). \\xc2\\xa0Service was great, everyone working there was so friendly and attentive - you can tell they really care about what they are doing and have incredible pride in their food and service. \\xc2\\xa0Even the owner was waiting tables and clearing dishes. \\xc2\\xa0 The food is amazing and the menu is really decently priced. \\xc2\\xa0This is the real deal. \\xc2\\xa0I had the steak tartare and my boyfriend had the duck - both were out of this world. \\xc2\\xa0It is a place where you can have a great meal and a few drinks without breaking the bank. \\xc2\\xa0I have recommended this place to everyone I know!',\n",

       " \"Been here twice and absolutely love it! I came here for the mussels and boy, they are no joke! So good! I literally craved their mussels after coming here the first time. I had the Parisinne first time and the Thai second time. While both were excellent, the Thai is by far the much tastier one. It had so much more flavor and the Thai spices really complimented the mussels. I know I know, it's a French restaurant, but trust me on this one, the Thai mussels are better than the Parissinne! The portion is quite big and it is served with a side of french fries...or should I say pomme frites? hahaha. The fries are alright, nothing too special. Atmosphere is great too. It's a cute little restaurant with about 10 tables. Quite cozy with cute French themed posters. I highly recommend this place! By far the best place I've been so far in the City for mussels!\",\n",
       " \"Husband and I yelped whatever French was nearby and Le Parisien came up and since it was one if the closer locations, we decided on this place. Great choice! We had no reservation but was seated right away (we got lucky!) the place is tiny. Ordered the duck pate for appetizers and we scarfed it down. Husband is not too fond of pate, but he liked this one. He ordered the bistrot steak frites, EXCELLENT!! We were both thoroughly pleased with his dish. I had the duck confit. It was delicious. But if I could choose, I'd order the steak frites.

       " 'Stayed in the Murray Hill neighborhood this weekend. My wife and I dined here on Friday night. We showed up a bit after 9:00 pm and were seated by 9:15. Definitely comparable to a Paris bistro based on how close together the tables are! I don\\'t say this as a negative; I think it brings a charm to a place. It definitely invokes memories of our trip to Paris. Somehow Chez Denise at lunchtime was quieter, though. This place was quite loud. I ordered the soup du jour which was cream of wild mushroom. My wife didn\\'t order a starter, but my soup was served with two spoons, without having to ask. Very nice -- and not unnoticed. I thought the soup was very nice, supple and velvety. My wife thought it was too thin. I saw it more as a dish for the working class, staying well shy of thick and cloying, rather than rich with butter and cream -- the kind of soup that puts sweaters on your teeth. These are expensive ingredients, and not always what you find in Parisian bistros. It was perfectly seasoned. For mains, my wife ordered the bistro steak frites (onglet, aka hangar steak), and I ordered steak tartare. I was a bit taken aback when the server asked if I knew what that was, like I was a rube. Maybe I look the part, I don\\'t know. I guess there are folks that have ordered it and freaked out when raw beef showed up. Whatever. Anyway, it was a very good steak tartare. My only complaint would be the egg yolk. It was a very pale yellow, indicating to me the \"good eggs\" weren\\'t used. The steak had that nice briny undertone you want, and was very fresh. It too was perfectly seasoned. And I think the portion was just right. My wife\\'s dish was yet again, perfectly executed Paris bistro. We both had frites. I felt like they might have been slightly overcooked, but the flavor was just awesome. It\\'s not too often I experience the sweetness that potatoes can exhibit. The flavor on these was just great. While I wish the wine list was a bit more broad, it offered some great selections, in particular some nice options from the Rh\\xc3\\xb4ne. We went with the C\\xc3\\xb4tes du Rh\\xc3\\xb4ne, which was everything I expected. There was a lovely looking Ch\\xc3\\xa2teauneuf-du-Pape on the menu I would have loved to try, but it was a bit rich for my budget that evening. Overall we had a great experience. Would definitely recommend.',\n",

       " 'Below average food and ambiance.',\n",
       " 'The waiter was rushing us in and did not even care if we made a reservation or not. He seemed very uninterested in serving us when we decided not to drink. Mussels Marinieres was okay. A bit too salty, so I tried to eat with bread (a lot of bread). The french fries were super hard and juiced with smelly oil.',\n",

Espresso only!\") \\xc2\\xa0 But the reasonably priced and very tasty food -- and the reasonably priced wine list -- here is what draws the crowds (do yourself a favor- make a reservation!). \\xc2\\xa0The perfectly juicy pan roasted chicken ($19) is served with wild mushrooms, and a heavenly potato puree. \\xc2\\xa0And though I never order pasta at French restaurants, I was craving some serious carbs, so I had the pappardelle with cherry tomatoes, basil, and asiago - this tasted like summer, pure and simple, but with a serious kick of crushed red pepper. It\\'s nice to know that if you have a friend coming in from Grand Central, the only option isn\\'t Chipotle.',\n",
       " 'The 14.95 fixe priced brunch brought me and my friends in Saturday morning. The meal started off great with a round of mimosas and great conversation. I unfortunately ordered the Croque Monsieur and was excited for it. But when I got my food, it was cold, the cheese was congealed and tasted like rubber. The ham tasted like package deli meat... The kind with the slime and the \"brioche\" was the ends of a bread loaf. I felt like puking after two bites. It was literally inedible and super dissappointing. Ugh never again!',\n",
       " \"Went for dinner at 7:30 on a Saturday night, with a reservation. Tips: I would definitely go with a reservation--seating is very limited, and the space is small, so without a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, getting a seat would take a while. Food: Ordered the steak tartare--friends ordered the french onion soup, endive salad, steak frites. The steak tartare was very yummy (although I've never had any before, so I have nothing to which I can compare it). A little too garlic-y, but nonetheless quite tasty for a patty of ground raw meat. It was served with fries, but it was annoying that the fries they gave me were clearly the end bits (barely 1 inch long fries) while my friends got the long, normal fries.... Steak frites were also very good, if a little too salty. Wine selection is fair as well, with good prices ($29 for a bottle of sauvignon blanc, $8 for the glass). We also tried the creme brulee and it was a great choice--I don't usually like creme brulee, but it wasn't too sweet, and the textures were indicative of a well-made brulee. Service: The two French owners (I presumed) are friendly and prompt with their service and communication. Very accommodating. However, the server who gave us our food was too brusque, a little unfriendly, and didn't have very good service manners (i.e. just grabbing things from in front of us in a brusque manner/shoving things aside kind of carelessly). Will definitely come back again, and it's definitely a good place for a date.\",\n",

Don\\'t know why but I was expecting more of a romantic high end atmosphere... and I\\'m glad that it wasn\\'t. The mood was casual yet intimate and had a certain je ne sais quoi with its vintage posters, caf\\xc3\\xa9 furniture and candles. It reminded me of all those little bistros I would pop into for a meal while running around gay Paris (pronounced \"PAH-ree\" of course). The owners are French so when it comes to generating that French bistro feel, they know what they\\'re doing. One look at the menu and I was hooked. Steak? Duck? Mussels? Tartare? Check, check and double check. Heck, they even have escargot. I don\\'t eat snails though; I had too many of them as pets as a child. Still, they got \\'em. Appetizers -Duck Prosciutto with Melon and Fennel Salad: To start, I had this special. Although the duck was tasty and the melon ripe and juicy, I just wish there had been more of le quack. Oh well. -French Onion Soup: My friend ordered this for his appetizer. I was able to steal a hearty spoonful of the broth/cheese/bread combo and thought it was superb. Just how I remembered it. Entrees -Duck Confit with Crispy Potatoes, Mushrooms and Fris\\xc3\\xa9e Salad: The potatoes weren\\'t particularly crispy but the duck skin sure was! Crispy on the outside and juice dark meat on the inside on top of a fresh bed of fris\\xc3\\xa9e and thinly sliced mushrooms. My only qualm was that portion was on the small side as well. I guess they guard their duck very closely here. -Steak Tartare with Salad and French Fries: Definitely my favorite of the night and the LARGEST of all the entrees. They present you with a giant slab of perfectly seasoned raw beef with a raw egg yolk on top in it\\'s shell alongside a bed of fresh greens. Oh and they give you a hearty serving of delicious, crispy fries. If you love steak tartare this entree is your best bet! It satisfies all of your cravings. Ok my cravings. After all of this food, I had to forgo the dessert menu even though the items looked delicious. Other diners around me kept ordering the cr\\xc3\\xa8me br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e which I kept hearing was fantastic. Service throughout by our lovely French waiters was attentive but not overly so. I also loved the selection of wines by the glass which were posted on the giant chalk board near the front. Love that they have wines from Cote du Rhone. La Parisien has definitely become my go to French restaurant that won\\'t cost me my first born.

My friend had the French onion soup and pork tenderloin which I was able to taste and enjoyed both very much. Overall, that was a hit experience. However the second time my party and I shared the Thai mussels as an appetizer portion. Though it was still flavorful, the Espagnole was definitely better. I decided to go a bit more adventurous and had their special for the night - monkfish with a potato pur\\xc3\\xa9e, scallions, mushrooms. That was a mistake! It could've been 5 bites and for $25?! My friend's steak frites, the most highlighted menu item, was really good. Juicy, savory, appetizing but then again how can you go wrong with steak frites!

For entrees, I got a white fish, which was good, but his dish rocked the whole meal: bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. I was able to try a bite, and had serious food envy. The crispy bacon contrasted the melt-in-your-mouth tenderloin perfectly. I wanted to trade entrees, it was so good. We split the creme brulee for dessert.

The space itself has been made to look like a small Left Bank bistro complete with fading French posters and newspapers about World Cup victories and stuff. The service isn't too stiff and it isn't too loose. Our waitress had no idea what the specials were and she wasn't afraid to say so, but we never felt neglected or forgotten while we ate. The salmon entre was quite good and the pino grigio we had with it was also enjoyable. We would have stayed for more wine but we had other places to be. Most of the other patrons who were there before us were still there after we left and I wouldn't be surprised if they stayed there for hours.

Mussells were nicely steamed and the sauce adde a bit o kick to the dish. Main course was pork mendallions wrapped with bacon. Normally anything wrapped with bacon is a thumbs up for me but unfortunately the pork was a little dry for me. The wife's steak dish was a much better choice. For dessert we had the merengue floating in custard pudding. Excellent. The service was attentive and unobstrusive. The atmopshere had a nice busy vibe but not overly crowded.

Love it. It's pretty small and can seem kind of romantic, but I'd say it's the perfect vibe for brunch. I got the Eggs Florentine and my friend got the Poached Eggs with smoked salmon. Both were very good! Comes with a small salad and french fries and the eggs on English muffins. Definitely enough food! I wouldn't say it's the best poached eggs or brunch meal, but def good enough. Mimosa was also pretty tasty (though small). My friend ordered a cup of coffee and when the guy delivered it he ended up spilling the coffee everywhere, which was kind of a mess. But it ended up being on the house (we didn't even ask) so that was really nice. Coffee also has free refills.

       " 'I\\'ve lived in the neighborhood for 9 years and my go to French bistro has always been Les Halles. Looking to try something else my husband and I decided to go to Le Parisien. One Friday night a few weeks ago my husband and I walked in to Le Parisien after our movie at Kips Bay let out. The ma\\xc3\\xaetre d\\' greeted us at the door and we said \"table for two,\" and he said, \"ok, but you have to order right away because we close in 5 minutes.\" Since it\\'s a very small restaurant most of the patrons heard this and looked at us. What he should\\'ve said was, \"I\\'m sorry but we are closing in 5 minutes\" or something else along those lines. We would\\'ve understood. Embarrassed, my husband and I walked out and went to Les Halles. We\\'ll never try Le Parisien again. What a terrible way to treat customers.',\n",
       " \"Honestly loved this place. \\xc2\\xa0I think it's great for taking fans of french cuisine to (even if they have actual experience from visiting France) or would make a perfect date night for that someone special. I have to admit that more often than not I order the Saut\\xc3\\xa9ed Calf's Liver as my entree, but that is just because it is soooo delicious and has never disappointed me. \\xc2\\xa0It's extremely rich and requires a taste for liver, but if that sounds like your thing I promise you will be in heaven. We've sampled several of the apps and my wife always tries different entrees. \\xc2\\xa0They've all been a hit with us, and our guests. \\xc2\\xa0Roasted beet salad, French Onion Soup, and the Escargot all come to mind as recommended appetizers. \\xc2\\xa0My wife has let me sample her Bistro Steak (great frites!) and her Duck Confit and they also come easily recommended. It's not just the food. \\xc2\\xa0The service has been exemplary and the ambience feels like it's just a slice of Provence in NYC. \\xc2\\xa0And the reasonability of the prices far exceed anything I have ever seen in NYC, with appetizers averaging $9-10 and the most delicious entrees starting at $16, but never exceeding $24 which in my opinion is a steal for the best French cuisine I have tasted in Manhattan so far. To the team at Le Parisien, I tip my beret to you!\",\n",

I think it completely accomplishes this goal. The posters lining the walls, the dimly lit decor, and the European-accent-bearing staff all contribute to bringing me back to Paris. I started with the soup du jour - the cream of turnip soup. It was incredible. Sure, it was a bit heavy on the cream side, but I really couldn\\'t complain because the turnip flavor wasn\\'t masked. I thought I was taking a risk by ordering it, but it came through. I got the chicken as my entree. Some of the best chicken I\\'ve ever had. The mushrooms and gravy sauce complemented it perfectly. I highly recommend the chicken. We also split a bottle of the $31 Cotes du Rhone. It was definitely a quality wine. Maybe not the best Cotes out there, but for $31 in the city, definitely a good buy. I tried the \"floating island\" and the profiterole desserts, along with the two dessert wines. All of them were delicious. I especially recommend the \"floating island\" - airy but satisfying. Best part is that it\\'s just a few avenues away from Penn Station, and it\\'s quite cheap! Definitely worth checking out!',\n",

The owners aren't going to be at your table constantly poking you to ask if you're okay- they leave you alone to your conversation.

But in the end we waited for 30 minutes, without even being apologized AT ALL. So I started to ask the restaurant owner: \" do we get any discount or compensation for waiting so long?\" The owner said:\" no, This is Manhattan, and you don\\'t give me this attitude.

The price fix included one drink and in an unusual turn of events, I skipped the booze and asked for just coffee. \\xc2\\xa0My friend asked for decaf and I thought it was odd that they didn't have a regular decaf coffee but the waitress suggested my friend drink a decaf Americano instead. \\xc2\\xa0I ordered the Poached Eggs with salmon and my friend ordered the chicken sandwich. \\xc2\\xa0My eggs were extremely tasty although slightly cold but the French fries were fantastic - completely crispy without being greasy. \\xc2\\xa0The spicy mustard sauce on the side was YUM. \\xc2\\xa0My friend said her sandwich was superb.

I'm only giving it 4 stars though because the bathroom was pretty gnarly. I watched a program the other day which interviewed a famous restauranteur who stated that a restaurant's bathroom tidiness is entirely indicative of the restaurant's kitchen cleanliness...

BTW, when people of a certain ethnicity dine at a place that serve said ethnicity's food, that's always a good thing. We had a reservation, but were given a slight wait which was not a problem. The Mrs. speaks French, and they responded right back. It's always great when non-American places can speak the language of the the food they claim to serve. For dinner, we split the baby spinach salad (ok) salad, she had the mussels; mariners and parissine (she enjoyed), and Steak Frites. They give you a lot of food for the low price. Everything was tasty. The Mrs. is a wine gal, and she wasn't very impressed with a wine list. A french place with a disappointing wine list automatically gets one star taken off.

Really tender and done perfectly well. However, I wish there was more garlicky goodness. Duck Confit - super moist and tender. LOVE LOVE LOVE Country Pate - didn't expect this to be so good, since some pate has a bit too much mineral taste, but this one I definitely enjoy.

All of us ordered the brunch special. I had the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax on English Muffins with Hollandaise Sauce with the sangria. The sangria was delicious and after just half of a glass, the warmth began spreading over my cheeks. I love poached eggs and salmon and thoroughly enjoyed my dish.

It was topped with little pieces of apple compote and maple syrup on the side. Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine but the presentation totally turned me off as I was expecting some fresh fruit or something remotely exciting to compliment it! I guess for $12.95 I can't be too picky about what I'm getting but in comparison to most brunch spots I've been to in the City the French Toast here was really embarrassing.

The toast was overcooked and I can make a better toast at home. Service: Terrible! The waiter asked my friend at least 5 times if he could take his plate away (with an unpleasant tone) while there were still a lot of food left and we were just having a conversation.

Even my parents, who are old school Chinese and eat only Asian food, loved this place. The prices are reasonable for the kind of dining experience they provide. Will definitely come back on a weekend to try their brunch. A Croque Madame sounds pretty good right now.',\n",
       " \"I visited this small hidden gem last week. What a delightful surprise. From the outside, it looks like a very small outdated restaurant. But as soon as you step foot inside, you feel the french style start to take over. We ordered the escargot and duck pate as appetizers, both were delicious and authentic. Escargot was light with only a little bit of herb and garlic oil and the pate was delicious with the cornichons (small pickles). Only suggestion for the pate is to ask for more bread, it wasn't enough to enjoy the pate fully. Since I wanted to try something new, I order the Thai mussel pot and my friend ordered pork tenderloin. My mussel pot came with fries which a little disappointing. The tenderloin was absolutely delicious. I would recommend it to everyone. The best of my entire dinner was the dessert...We had profiteroles. It's ice cream puff with warm chocolate sauce pour over it. DELICIOUS! MUST GET! It was so delicious my friend and I didn't say anything until the dish was finish. We were there on a Tuesday around 5:30pm. No wait. But it did get quite busy by the time we left which was around 7...The tables are close to each other so I would assume it would be quite nosy when it gets busy.\",\n",

The onion soup was okay & the salad was fantastic. I had the steak & frites as entree and it was very delicious. Steak was very tender- cooked to perfection. Frites were shoestring fries - very French. We also had mussels at the table and it was very good.

We ordered: -French onion soup: authentic, so if you are used to chain restaurants like TGIF, then you will feel it has less taste and more bland. -Le Parisien salad with Vinaigrette dressing: delicious. I always love european salads! -2 of their daily special fish: my favorite was the spinach pea puree with special house made lemon sauce! DELICIOUS! I read many reviews and they suggested their mussels was something to order, but I mean mussels will always be mussels. If you are going to try French, do their special of the day, you can never go wrong with that!

Not shy at all on the Saffron. The Mussels were plentiful and perfectly cooked. The Frites, as other reviewers have mentioned, are deee-vine. Seriously. I was very full from the mussels, but I HAD TO FINISH my frites. They were so delicious. I usually use those little friend potatoes to pick up the leftover juices of the mussels, but no no, I didn't want to mess with the crispy goodness. They were perfect.

We had two types of mussel pots: one was thai and the other I can't remember...that just goes to show how memorable the latter was. I would say the thai flavor they offer is worth trying if only for the reason that it doesn't seem to be offered in many other places. And of course, the frites were solid too.

Now, the amazing French food: --The French onion soup comes piping hot out of the oven. It\\'s extremely flavorful, down to all the elements: it has a sweet onion-y broth, a soggy but crusty crouton, and gooey cheese. --I tried steak tartare for the first time. It was quite an experience. It came with an egg yolk in a half shell, salad and a big heap of fries on the side. The \"steak\" was interesting...I have nothing to compare it to, but I think I liked it. The fries are out of this world..very potato-y and fancy. --We also got a dessert \"profit\"something...it was everything you\\'d want in a French pastry The bill for 4, with 2 bottles of wine, was $200.

       " \"I love French food. I absolutely love it. In fact, I consider myself somewhat of a Francophile. It was last minute and my friends and I wanted to go out to in the city, on a Friday night, without reservations. This really limited the amount of places we could go to. After a while, after looking through opentable, I settled on Le Parisien. The decor is quite lovely, and the restaurant has a nice, cozy French bistro feeling. Now onto the food. My first dish was a special, it was a dish of fried oysters with risotto, all fried together. The dish wasn't anything special, as it just tasted fried, but I couldn't tell that I was eating oyster because it was so deep fried and it was almost like eating the skin of a deep fried chicken, with a bit of a seafood aftertaste. My next dish was their chicken. The chicken was quite good and the mashed potatoes on the side were very delicious. It was pretty good, but again, nothing memorable. I had dessert too, the Apple pie, or more like Tart Tatin. That was good. This place was good, but not great. I will probably not come back here for a while because there's too many other French restaurants I have to eat at and this place didn't produce too memorable of a dining experience for me. But maybe someday I'll be back...\",\n",

I've been 3 times for brunch with 3 different sets of people and once for a solo dinner and have always had a great experience. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the food is classically delicious. If you come for the $12.95 brunch w/ 1 free drink, make sure you or somebody in your party orders the croque monsieur and that you get to taste it, because it is AMAZING. Plus: if you want a croque madame, they will add the egg at no additional charge! I also recommend the eggs florentine, because hollandaise, eggs, and spinach are apparently a match made in brunch food heaven. As for the drinks, both the mimosas and the sangria are tasty with good ratios of fruit juices to alcohol. Since the only time I came here for dinner it was by my lonesome, I can't comment on anything outside of the PEI mussels (which were perfect!) and the wine by the glass (standard $8 glass, good wine), but I can tell you I know enough from that and the brunch to plan on coming back for dinner soon. The best part of all is that I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table here, ever, and with the exception of the 1st time I came I've always just walked in.

A sangria or mimosa comes with the brunch I believe and you can order additional. Not the best drunken brunch spot but if you just want one or two drinks its great. I loved the sangria and the mimosa's seemed a little smaller, so I think its the better value as well. \\xc2\\xa0 After tax and tip, meals average about $16 a person, which is definitely reasonable.

Make sure you don\\'t order the Steak Tartare unless you know that it is a patty of raw meat with a raw egg on top. My friend ordered it and was surprised to say the least as the menu has little to no information on the dishes available. Wine was good, average price for the area.

I had the croque monsier & my friend had the filet mignon carpaccio, both dishes were $12 if I remember correctly. The croque monsieur was very good - the bread was fluffy and buttery, the salad was a perfect side dish. My friend described his filet mignon carpaccio as sort of like roast beef...I felt bad b/c he basically got maybe 6 small, very thin slices of beef under some salad & larger shavings of cheese. Pretty presentation but not filling at all. I gave him 1/4 of my lunch to help hold him over at work. My croque monsieur was also pretty small & after the meal, I was still hungry.

Service was a friendly French lady, the food came out pretty quickly and best of all they leave you alone until you ask for a bill. This gave us ample time to listen to the rude girl at the table next to us take an extremely long, personal phone call at the table in front of her friends.

There aren't many tables in the restaurant, and with the windows open, it very much had the feel of a small Parisian cafe (or at least what I remember them to be like from visits long ago). The service was decent, although I would say that it was a bit slower than I have experienced elsewhere. I didn't mind it that much, given it's a slow holiday weekend, but I probably would've been less blase about it if I was in a rush. The food itself was simple and light, which I really enjoyed. I got the French toast, which was indeed fluffy and definitely on the lighter end of French toasts I've had in the past. You get loads of sugar sprinkled on top, with apple compote on top - a nice complement that isn't too strong and overwhelm the toast with syrup on it. I sampled the wild vegetable omelet my girlfriend had, which was much lighter than other omelets I've had - most likely due to no cheese. The vegetables were a wide variety, though, and the herbs added a dash of flavor that you usually don't get. We got a pot of mussels for the table to share; these were delicious (especially the broth in which they were cooked), but I did feel like they may have been steamed a little on the long side. For brunch, I was also sorely disappointed with the orange juice - every city I can recall serves fresh OJ on their brunch menu; Le Parisien serves up OJ that tastes like concentrated Minute Maid with ice in it. The beverage aside, the rest of the meal was very pleasant. $13 for brunch is a pretty decent deal, and they have a good selection of choices for the meal. I'm not sure if I'd come back frequently - there are an abundance of good places in the neighborhood - but it's a solid alternative to a place like Penelope's.\",\n",

We lingered over tiramisu and wine and the restaurant staff was pleasant and attentive but we did begin to feel pressure to hurry up and finish up as the restaurant started to fill up and people were waiting by the door.

Bits of chorizo floating in it, and the tomato broth had the right amount of acidity. The service was decent, it took us awhile to get seated, but the hostess was very nice and apologized for the wait. NOTE: we came with 6 people so for a small French bistro, it wasn't too bad. Only thing I was not a fan of was the bread. It was terribly stale and didn't have any good texture at all. Kind of strange to complain about the free bread that comes before the meal, but I was pretty hungry when I first came in, and the bread was terribly unsatisfying. Overall, it was a good time, and it wasn't terribly expensive. Ordering a couple bottles of wine was a good idea, especially because it didn't break the bank as much as a bottle of wine would at any other fine dining restaurant.

I decided to try the one stuffed with mushrooms and asiago cheese -- served with a side of mixed green salad and frites (fries). Very tasty. One small negative: my OJ arrived with cubes in it (a pet peeve). I know some folks take ice in just about every beverage but I see this as a faux pas in OJ.

Don't miss the beet salad, steak tartare, escargot, Thai mussels with frites, the duck, the lamb and the bread pudding. Only disappointment was that the duck pate only shows up on select days. Wine is AFFORDABLE! And Anna, who runs the place, is so sweet, helpful and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back!\",\n",

Skip the desserts. For brunch, their french toast is YUM, get it for dessert instead of the Tart Tartine. Portions are not big like the other neighborhood joints, but most things are priced reasonably.\",\n",

Regarding the service, our french waitress (or owner?) gave us enough time to peruse our menus, but didn't neglect us either. She was knowledgeable and pleasant. I agree with the previous reviewer regarding the grilled wild salmon entree...It's hard for most places to make this sort of dish anything other than bland. Here, the dish was savory and the salmon was tender. (Sometimes there is no substitute for butter!) My friend's entree was great as well, but we both found ourselves wishing we had ordered some pomme frites as we watched them make their way to another table. My Moroccan squid appetizer was very nice, but nothing remarkable. I wouldn't mind trying their onion soup next time. Regarding the wine, we liked their selection. My friend and I were not all that eager to split a botte of wine, so we split a carafe. A nice option to have. I looked forward to returning for some more taste tests.\",\n",

Growing up with a French father, I've grown to love French cuisine and I crave it every now and again. This place not only feels like it's stuck in the middle of Paris (due to the chalk board wine list and old French posters), but the owner is extremely nice too. Not to mention the food was absolutely delicious. I had the chilled tomato soup special to start. It wasn't gazpacho, but it had similar flavors and was delicious. Then I had the grilled salmon with lentil salad and bacon - delicious, I would get it again. My boyfriend had the escargot, which were cooked perfectly (not too chewy, not too crispy) and the steak frites which had a delicious peppercorn sauce. I plan to go again soon to try their brunch.....\",\n",

For our table, we even had to move it aside to sit on the inside seat, but Americans overrate space imo anyways :) The friendly and chatty lady next to us warned us not to get the escargots because they weren't garlicky enough, but she highly recommended the steak special. We didn't even end up getting the specials because the regular menu had so many good looking things. I started off with the endive, roasted bosc pear, roquefort, walnut relish, balsamic port vinaigrette salad which was plated in a beautiful fan pattern as perfect little morsels of flavor. The Parisien mussels with saffron and mustard cream was next. The sauce was a hair on the salty side, but the mussels themselves were well cooked and juicy. For main entree, I had the grilled wild salmon, warm spinach & lentil salad with bacon vinaigrette. These are all things that can taste quite bland, but it was shockingly flavorful! Those French really know how to work the spices. I had a bite of the pork tenderloin, bosc pears, brussels sprouts, bacon, and calvados sauce too, and it was similarly fabulous. Dessert: blood orange sorbet avec profiteroles. Rich, decadent, and yelling for a long walk to work off the pounds afterwards, but definitely worth it!

I don't drink too much coffee, maybe one cup a day, but when I do drink it, I want the good stuff. Meaning, I'm looking for a hipster/trendy shop where I am most likely going to shell out around $4 for a cold brew. Not a Starbucks or Dunkin, and especially not the crappy java from the work cafeteria. As I ventured out this morning looking for a caffeine boost, I opened up Yelp to see what was around. Unfortunately, my phone service is absolutely terrible around my office so I went for a short walk hoping to run into a decent place. Luckily, I ran into Blue Spoon (which is literally steps away from my office). Their outdoor sign enticed me as I read that they brew Intelligentsia coffee and offer breads and pastries from Balthazar and Ceci-Cela. I was immediately greeted with a smile at the counter and surprisingly there was no line. It's summer so I went for a cold brew ($4) and picked up a fresh piece of fruit, although I was extremely tempted to try the delicious looking pastries and bread from Balthazar and Ceci-Cela. I'm happy to have this place right around the corner from my office.

Originally I had ordered a soy latte but then I saw that they had honey lavender lattes. Say what?! So eager to try it out, I ordered an iced honey lavender soy latte. Two words: fricken amazing.

I know coffee-snobs don't believe in sweet flavored drinks, BUT I love how Blue Spoon realizes that is what the trend is, their flavored drinks are perfectly balanced. They use Monin syrups, which is the only kind of syrup I drink for flavored stuff.

The employees nearly always have smiles on their faces, and their enthusiasm for serving top-notch coffee and morning vittles is infectious. The soundtrack is usually really good, low-key indie rock, which suits me just fine.

As before I went with the house blend, served up by a personable guy at the counter. I even witnessed him troubleshooting an issue with a customer--the chili supply had run dry--and it appeared to be a very positive affair. My lunch was the Goat Cheese Panini, and I completely enjoyed it. Creamy goat cheese, tart roasted red peppers and a crisp panini bread with just a hint of balsamic was a winner. My only gripe is that, unless you're ordering just coffee, there isn't any place to stand and wait. \\xc2\\xa0I crammed myself by the sugar and milk station, hanging by the red phone on the counter (so THAT'S what happened to the hotline to the Kremlin after the end of the Cold War!).

I'm not a picky guy but it is annoying when you are paying $20 + for a pizza. I'm not sure what the issue is but I hope they get it fixed. Delivery service is inconsistent in delivery time (15-45 minutes) but the food does arrive hot every time. In addition to their pies their salads and sandwiches are also delicious, especially the pepperoni hero.\",\n",

The food is not the only aspect of this restaurant to gush over, the staff is warm, friendly, attentive and incredibly capable. The atmosphere is inviting and relaxed. The decor accentuates the environment with its reclaimed and repurposed materials. The beauty is in the details and their are so many beautifully executed details that you can feel the hard work and love that was poured into the place by the owners. \\xc2\\xa0 The food is the stand out, the executive chef really knows how to put a perfectly composed dish in front of you. The lamb was fork tender, paired with potatoes that were cooked lightly enough to still have the textural integrity needed to complement the silky lamb. The parsnip gnocchi, I prefer to call the parsnip pillows myself. Flawlessly toasted on the outside but light as air when you bite into them. The fried brussel sprouts are a must have, they have an indulgent quality about them that gets you thinking about the last time you ate a vegetable with such enthusiasm. The trout dish was exceptional, I don\\'t often use the words \"rich and creamy\" to describe a fish dish but this one is the definition of rich and creamy. Peanuts boiled and pureed are the bed that an expertly broiled piece of trout sits a top. The skin of the trout is crisp and the delicate flaky white meat marry\\'s together with the pureed peanuts in a refreshing and inventive take on your familiar seafood entree. The nice thing about the menu here is it\\'s not a huge commitment. They have something that delights any mood or pallet you may be experiencing. The portions are appropriate to the cost which is so appreciated as a diner. You can easily share small plates or have just one entree and leave satiated. The current BYOB option gives you an opportunity to pair the food with what you acknowledge to be your preference in spirits. We have lived in this neighborhood for a number of years and are so pleased to see this new restaurant open in our area. With such quality food and comfortable environment its well on its way to becoming a staple in our daily routine.',\n",

From the outside look like all the other apartments near it just with a garage door not to far from the door making a slight difference. Well I'm glad they had that little sign up. We went in to find a warm place with warm colors of wood and the smell of fresh coffee just brewed greeting us with friendly people at the bar drinking from their coffee cups. A beautiful deity amazon woman with big hair greeted us and gracefully took us to a deeper area. A room completely made of windows ambient lightning and soulful music playing. I sat down on a church pew really feeling the sacredness of this place. We looked at the menu to find things that my friend could eat. I got the endive and she got the braised salsify to start. Then I got a almond stuffed trout and my friend got a vegetable burger. Followed by the parsnip yogurt dessert. The endive was savory and refreshing. I tasted the braised salsify assuming it would be salty but was happy to find a subtle sweetness. The almond trout was big enough for two people to eat but bc of this snow my appetite was large enough. The veggie burger she enjoyed saying she would come back for it again. The dessert was a masterpiece with the pyramid shape topped with a glass like caramel, a rare taste that wasn't overly sweet but just right.

Wir leben \\xc2\\xa0schon \\xc3\\xbcber zehn Jahre in Bundesrepublik Deutschland und haben nie einmal gedacht, wie viel Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nderhass steckt in manchen Deutschen. Aber dass deutsches Gericht diesen Hass unterst\\xc3\\xbctzt, hatte ich nie einmal erwartet. Ich m\\xc3\\xb6chte mich kurz fassen. Es geht um das Urteil Im Namen des Volkes des Amtsgerichts Schorndorf unter dem Aktenzeichen 6 C 327/13, verk\\xc3\\xbcndet am 07.11.2013. Die deutsche Familie H. (Kl\\xc3\\xa4ger) hat die Ausl\\xc3\\xa4ndische Familie (mich und meine Familie \\xc2\\xa0= Angeklagte) \\xc3\\xbcber Jahre als Verbrecher dargestellt. Eines Tages haben die Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder (ich) die Deutschen angefordert sich an der Wahrheit zu halten. Also, keine L\\xc3\\xbcgengeschichten mehr. Die Deutschen waren \\xc2\\xa0damit so beleidigt, dass sie die ausl\\xc3\\xa4ndische Familie (wieder aufgrund bewusst gelogener Anzeige!) vor Gericht gestellt hatten! Das Gericht hat bewiesen, dass deutsche Familie die ganzen, rein erfundenen Geschichten doch \\xc2\\xa0nicht nur m\\xc3\\xbcndlich, sondern auch schriftlich jahrelang dar gelegt hatte. Auch dass die Klage auf einer bewussten L\\xc3\\xbcge basiert ist. Im \\xc2\\xa0Prozess kam mehr aufs Licht, dies wurde aber \"aus Versehen?\" nicht dokumentiert, z.B. dass der Kl\\xc3\\xa4ger mit dem Umlaufbrief sich besch\\xc3\\xa4ftigte um Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder zwangsl\\xc3\\xa4ufig aus dem Haus zu vertreiben (also klare Beweise des Hasses). Dabei wurden diese L\\xc3\\xbcgengeschichten als Grund der Zwangsr\\xc3\\xa4umung vorgesehen! Eigentlich, sollte es als bewusste, \\xc2\\xa0jahrelange Taten gegen Ausl\\xc3\\xa4ndische Familie hei\\xc3\\x9fen. Was wurde der ausl\\xc3\\xa4ndischen Familie vorgeworfen? Nur das, dass sie gefordert hat diesen Taten das Ende zu setzen. Aber, wie denken Sie, wer wurde \\xc3\\xbcberwiegend (4.500,00 \\xe2\\x82\\xac) bestraft? Ja! Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder! F\\xc3\\xbcr das Gericht wurde es klar, dass die Familie H. in jedem Punkt gelogen hatte. Aber es war nicht wichtig! Wichtiger war die Frage: \"Warum hat Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder gewagt den Deutschen zu sagen, dass sie mit L\\xc3\\xbcgengeschichten aufh\\xc3\\xb6ren m\\xc3\\xbcssen? Dabei war das Gericht ohne Beweise (erste Sitzung) gerechter als mit Beweisen! (zweite Sitzung). (Auch ein Beweis daf\\xc3\\xbcr, dass die Beweise eigentlich keine Rolle spielen - die Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder m\\xc3\\xbcssen Verbrecher sein!) \\xc2\\xa0 In der ersten Gerichtssitzung hat die Richterin Verschlag gemacht die Gerichtskosten 1/2 zu 1/2 zu teilen??? Das hat der Kl\\xc3\\xa4ger nat\\xc3\\xbcrlich voll abgelehnt. Auf die Frage der Richterin, was erwartet man vom Gericht? Antwortete der Kl\\xc3\\xa4ger: \"Es ist mir alles egal. Hauptsache Angeklagte mehr zahlt\". Und im zweiten Sitz wurde das Gericht zum Wunschkonzert des Kl\\xc3\\xa4gers! Ich habe das Urteil des Amtsgerichts und Sachverhalt einem anderen Rechtsanwalt gegeben. Er hat erst gesagt, dass das Urteil sehr komisch sei und er wird mit Berufungsklage beim Landgericht Stuttgart \\xc2\\xa0das Urteil widerrufen. Sp\\xc3\\xa4ter war er sehr emp\\xc3\\xb6rt. Mir hat er nur eines gesagt, dass sie alle zusammen sind und wir erreichen dort nichts au\\xc3\\x9fer weitere 4000,00 \\xe2\\x82\\xac zu zahlen. (Beschluss Gesch\\xc3\\xa4ftsnummer: 13 S 208/13 Aktenzeichen: 6 C 327/13 des Landgerichts Stuttgart). Ist es der politische Trend, dass man die Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder als Verbrecher darstellen soll? Also, deutsche l\\xc3\\xbcgen, sogar in der Anklage. Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder zahlen - so lautet das Gerichtsurteil. Damit wurde Hetzjagd aber noch l\\xc3\\xa4ngst nicht beendet. In der Eigent\\xc3\\xbcmerversammlung 2014 hat Herr Hausverwalter, vom Gerichtsurteil motiviert, gesagt, dass es, unter anderem Versperren der Kellert\\xc3\\xbcr usw. als Bote an uns gewesen war, \\xc2\\xa0dass wir (Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder) in dem Haus nicht gew\\xc3\\xbcnscht sind und ich soll aufh\\xc3\\xb6ren mich zu verteidigen. Was \\xc3\\xbcber mich und meine Familie erz\\xc3\\xa4hlt wird, soll ich schweigend annehmen. Ich wollte wiedersprechen mit der Aussage: \"Aber nicht die L\\xc3\\xbcgengeschichten...\" Und habe die Antwort von Hausverwalter erhalten: \"Wenn es euch nicht g\\xc3\\xa4be, sollte Familie H. nicht l\\xc3\\xbcgen\"??? Hat Familie H. im Auftrag gelogen um zu zeigen wie schlecht Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder sein sollen??! \\xc2\\xa0 Also, scheinbar, immer \\xc3\\xb6fter in Deutschland das Wort \"Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder\" automatisch mit dem Wort \"Verbrecher\" identifiziert\" ist. Damit wurde noch nicht das Ende der Geschichte gesetzt. Vor dem Gericht wurden nur b\\xc3\\xb6se Geschichten \\xc3\\xbcber Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder ausgesprochen. Jetzt kam es zu Erniedrigungstaten. Jetzt hat ihr Hass, vom Gerichtsurteil motiviert, sich weiterentwickelt - von L\\xc3\\xbcgen bis zum Rechte weg zu nehmen. \\xc2\\xa0Das Gericht, anstatt Hass zu bremsen, hat das Gegenteil erreicht. In der Eigent\\xc3\\xbcmerversammlung 2014 hat Herr Hausverwalter einen Vorschlag gemacht, der Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nderfamilie ihre Rechte auf Gemeinn\\xc3\\xbctzige R\\xc3\\xa4ume \\xc2\\xa0zu benutzen, stark zu reduzieren, im Vergleich mit den anderen Eigent\\xc3\\xbcmern. Auf die Frage, warum die Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder nicht gleiche Rechte haben d\\xc3\\xbcrfen, hat Herr Verwalter folgende Antwort gegeben: \"Die Frage ist richtig, die Ausl\\xc3\\xa4nder haben das Recht, aber wen juckt das? Wir nehmen ihnen diese Rechte einfach weg. \\xc2\\xa0(Protokoll Eigent\\xc3\\xbcmerversammlung 2014). Herr Verwalter hat auch gesagt, dass das Haus, seit Ausl\\xc3\\xa4ndische Familie \\xc2\\xa0die Wohnung gekauft hatte, hat viel am Wert verloren. Fr\\xc3\\xbcher wohnten im Haus nur die Deutsche, jetzt nicht',\n",

We sat down at a high stool table, looked at the decently priced wine list (mostly Spanish and Argentine good wines), ordered some tempranillo, and we proceeded to tackle some pimientos de piquillo stuffed with cod (to die for), some grilled sardines (delicious), some exquisite cod croquettes and then, la piece de resistance, octopus Galician style (sauteed in olive oil and with piment\\xc3\\xb3n/paprika: just like in Galicia). At \\xc2\\xa0$5 to $6 for a tapa or about $11 for a raci\\xc3\\xb3n (double the size of the tapa), food of this caliber is a steal when compared with trendier or faux-upscale similar establishments catering to Catalan or Basque tapas in the West Village. The best way to appreciate Nai is to sit in your high table, have a bottle, let the tapas flow, and see and absorb the young atmosphere. And so we found ourselves returning to Nai several times. Last night, we visited again for the pimientos de piquillo stuffed with cod; croquettes of goat cheese wrapped in jam\\xc3\\xb3n serrano (delicious); meatballs in brandy (quite tasty); grilled chorizos (just as it reads, which left us wanting next time for the chorizos in an onion sauce and chorizo in cider), and toppled with a desert of fresh lime-laced strawberries stuffed with custard (exquisite). It is heartening that we still have so many items in the menu to work through..... What brings us back to Nai? \\xc2\\xa0Is it the young and low-key atmosphere which seems so true to form to tapas places in university towns like Santiago de Compostela? \\xc2\\xa0Is it the warm and attentive treatment at the hands of David (the owner) or Ra\\xc3\\xbal, the genial attendant from the Basque country? \\xc2\\xa0Is it the high quality Galician tapas that are thoroughly authentic, like back in Galicia, without contamination or \"adjustments\" to fit \"what the NY market would expect\"? I don\\'t know (but who\\'s asking?) \\xc2\\xa0One think for sure: the way David and his co-owner chef constantly and solidly deliver the goodies, I don\\'t think that I will have to worry for a while about high-priced debatable experiments involving chorizos toppled with mango and cilantro, just to appear hip.

I was DEFINITELY right! From the minute we walked in we were greeted and sat right away. We had a table right in front of the live Flamenco band which was a plus. We ordered a variety of tapas and each one out did the next. The tropical sangria was also very good and the entertainment was amazing! I know I scored some extra points with the in-laws by bringing them to Nai Tapas!\",\n",

I definitely recommend Nai Tapas for a night out in the city if you are looking for fantastic food, great service, and live entertainment!!!!',\n",
       " \"Amazing place with amazing service. We had the best time enjoying tapas and the show. The tapas were delicious and the sangria was delicious but more like juice rather than an alcoholic drink. The show on saturday night was absolutely one of the best flamenco shows I've ever seen. The performances lasted a few hours, it was amazing to see the women dance full of passion and energy. We all had an amazing time and I can't wait to come back.\",\n",

As soon as I came in to make reservations, I knew this place would be great. The decor is great; it's an intimate, low-lit place with exposed brick walls. Dinner was amazing. The best part was definitely the flamenco show. It is free, and lasts for hours. The dancers and singers were top notch!!! I felt like I was back in Madrid watching a show. The service was also amazing; with such a big group, our waiter was always available, smiled, and served us very quickly. The food was good, and there is a big variety of sangria. The prices for the tapas were also very reasonable. There is a flamenco show every Thursday & Saturday at 8:30. It is a must!\",\n",
       " 'I was there on Saturday night with three friends and what a great place! \\xc2\\xa0We ate a total of eight tapas, had two pitchers of sangria and we each paid around twenty dollars with tip included. \\xc2\\xa0Great food, great service, low prices and an awesome flamenco show. \\xc2\\xa0We will definitely be back.',\n",

       " \"Is this place real? Or did I dream this glorious dinner experience? Not really sure because everything about our night and experience here was AWESOME and for such a great price. Located in the East Village on 1st between 10th and 11th, I have passed Nai many times, and never thought anything of it. Nai came recommended to my friend Rachel which was perfect since we were craving two things: tapas and sangria. Okay... Where do I begin? Our waiter was one of the most attentive, friendly and knowledgable people I have ever encountered at a restaurant in this city. The service we experienced throughout our 3 and 1/2 hour meal at Nai Tapas got me thinking about how fantastic service has become rare, and we have just gotten used to mediocre service and being rushed in and out of restaurants so the next party can be seated. This is not the case at Nai. We enjoyed our dinner with warm welcome, as we were continually told to take our time, and thoroughly enjoy our food and drinks. And thank you sir, we did just that... On top of the 5 star service at this modest, authentic Spanish restaurant on 1st Ave, they offer happy hour until 8PM. $20 pitchers of sangria, with 4 flavors to choose from, the most important and insanely delicious being: the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. Rachel and I shared 2 pitchers throughout the course of the night and couldn't get enough. It was probably the best sangria I've had since sitting on the beaches of Spain, and with a sweet, bubbly, fizzy, happy buzz from the champagne. (I brought another friend 3 days later for happy hour). Nai offers a long menu of authentic Spanish tapas, ideal for ordering a bunch and sharing. This was a mission within itself since we wanted everything on the menu. Luckily for us, our waiter provided helpful tips, how they are prepared, and his personal favorites. They start you off with a baguette and olive oil, while you take your time and peruse the menu. We ordered seven tapas throughout the night, two or three at time, to stagger the flow of our meal while we enjoyed each, and sipped our sangria. Everything we ordered was fresh and flavorful, transporting me right back to Spain for the night, four blocks from my NY apartment. What to order: Fried goat cheese balls wrapped in Serrano ham with a slice of tomato on toast. Amazing. ($6) Gambas Al Ajillo- Grilled shrimp in garlic sauce. Garlicky, plump shrimp. ($6) Bacalao Frito- Chunks of cod, lightly fried. Fresh, crispy, and perfect with a squeeze of lemon. ($6) Patatas Aioli- Potatoes in a garlic aioli sauce. Crispy potatoes. Creamy garlic aioli. Unreal. ($5) Caracoles- Escargot in our house sauce. Escargot. Butter sauce. ($5) Albondiguillas Estofadas- Stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce. Tender, rich in vibrant spices. ($5) Stuffed peppers with ham and Manchego cheese, topped with Quail eggs. Over easy quail eggs. Melted cheese and ham on toast. ($7) Coconut Flan (Not pictured since we devoured so quickly). Delicious, creamy, sweet, tons of coconut. ($5) What I've been dreaming about for our next visit: Lomo Adobado Con Pimientos Asados- Seasoned pork loin with fresh roasted red peppers Pan Tumaca- Toast with a coating of tomato, topped with serrano ham & manchego cheese Madrid Tropical- Baby spinach, avocado, hearts of palm, sliced oranges, walnuts, red onions & strips of red peppers tossed in our house vinaigrette Mejillones A La Cerverza- Mussels cooked with shallots, garlic, cilantro and lager Pulpo A La Gallega- Spanish octopus in virgin olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika Croquetas De Jam\\xc3\\xb3n- Serrano ham croquettes\",\n",

       " 'Rude and pompous manager/staff (except for the bus boy) - mediocre food, but didn\\'t get sick, so if you\\'re looking for something not too special then try it out. \\xc2\\xa0 My wife researched somewhere new to go for brunch - found this place - which opens at 10am Sundays, which was what we\\'re looking for due to our schedule. Our party of 4 arrived at the door approx. 10:05 or so and the place was packed. Figured that was a good sign, so we waited the approx. 40 minute wait - at which time an employee, who I believe was the manager, came to us stating there was a table for 4 available but since we had \\xc2\\xa0our newborn baby he was trying to dissuade us from taking it because in his words - \"it is tight with a baby\" Well, guess what, the entire place is tight - no larger than my living room, but we were willing to give it a shot. \\xc2\\xa0The guy was hoping we would say no because a group of 4 of his friends or regulars arrived which he wanted to give that table to instead of my party. \\xc2\\xa0We were then seated and were given our water and offered coffee. We then sat there for quite sometime awaiting someone to take our order, no one came and so we continued to sit and still no one came while the waiter began taking orders from other customers who arrived after us. \\xc2\\xa0The manager walked by and saw one of our party had his menu in his hand and he snatched it out of his hand and tossed it into the menu bin as if he was put out. \\xc2\\xa0I had to finally ask the server to please take our order, which he did. For a place this size - HOW DO YOU FORGET PEOPLE SITTING 2 FEET FROM YOU?! EXCEPT if you want to forget purposely? \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0The food order was taken and we waited a normal amount of time for the size of an order we placed maybe slightly longer than would be expected but when the food arrived it was lukewarm and nothing to write home about. As we paid and left the manager ignored us and seemed extremely happy we were leaving. He never checked to see how our food was - nor did any of the staff. No one thanked us for coming to their establishment to eat - simply rude. I believe they didn\\'t want to serve us because we had a baby. \\xc2\\xa0Just a side note, our newborn baby who sleeps more than he is awake was no issue and barely made a peep the entire time. \\xc2\\xa0 I would NEVER RECOMMEND eating at this establishment as I don\\'t enjoy giving money to undeserving, disrespectful, arrogant, pompous people. \\xc2\\xa0As I said though, we did not get sick, so I guess it\\'s edible food.',\n",
       " \"The owner/waiter is incredibly RUDE RUDE RUDE. \\xc2\\xa0He yelled at me and my significant other for putting our winter gloves on the table when we sat down. \\xc2\\xa0For the rest of the duration of our meal, he told us only limited items on the menu were available(smirking and giggling); he slammed down our drinks staining our cloths. \\xc2\\xa0Nook WAS a place I would go to through the years BUT NO MORE due to this guy's attitude. \\xc2\\xa0Get over yourself sir, your restaurant is NOT Le Cirque as you put it! \\xc2\\xa0As far as the food, mediocre at best.\",\n",
       " 'After reading these reviews, the one thing I notice that everyone has in common is HOW F*ING AWFUL THE OWNER TREATS THE CUSTOMERS. We actually walked out because he was such a jerk and yelled at me in front of the whole restaurant. Nook has the worst customer service that I have ever seen in all of Manhattan. I made a reservation for 2 over the phone and when we came to the restaurant for our 9pm reservation the manager (or owner?) told us we never made a reservation. It was a complete lie and I showed him my phone with the call placed to his restaurant earlier that day - what happened to the \"customer is always right\" in the restaurant industry? Then he revised his story and said they were writing down reservations all day by accident for the wrong date and we should come back in 20-30 min for a table. We came back in 24 minutes and saw he had just seated another couple. The manager then glanced at us and refused to come to the front of the restaurant to speak to us. Finally I went to the back of the restaurant to ask him how long our table would be ready and he said it was still going to be a while. I asked him why he had sat the couple in front of us just now and he turned at me and glared, finally barking that they had a reservation before us. I questioned whether that was really true, since he had earlier told me the restaurant had \"messed up\" the reservations for tonight. Was he lying then or now? And when I say barked, he literally raised his voice so inappropriately at a customer that I took a step back and became nervous about what he would do next - the tables nearby us stopped and stared and it was very uncomfortable. My boyfriend and I immediately walked out and I will never go back there in my life. I hope no one else will subject themselves to such horrible treatment in the service industry. Plus, the food is nothing to rave about. The only reason people go there is because it is a cheap BYO - but I know plenty of others throughout Manhattan that are well worth the travel and wait rather than coming back here.',\n",

We ordered eggs benedict, eggs florentine, the soup of the day, and french toast. The egg dishes were terrible with strong tastes of vinegar on their eggs. The potatoes that came with the eggs were very bland and definitely not memorable in any good way. The soup was not tasty and in such small portion. The french toast was probably the worst. How do you mess up french toast? It was very soggy, not fluffy at all. The raspberry jam topping was overly tart and there were only 3 pieces of french toast, as to 4. Why the strange number? THe waiters were not friendly at all: they did not invite us in while we waited outside, they hurried us with the bill before we were done figuring out splitting the bill.',\n",

Iced coffee is most basic beverage on earth but they could not get that right, and when I asked for more syrup, they looked at me as if I were bizarre The scrambled eggs were fine but nothing you cant make at home, get some fesh salmon from Whole Foods and the right herbs, I am sure you can open a brunch place as well To be fair the eggs benedict was great, but not wow. As expected from a good brunch place. Food was alright but service was lousy, so only 2 stars.',\n",

Fun if you're looking for a BYO but definitely better in the area. \\xc2\\xa0 Also the owner is a bit odd. \\xc2\\xa0He can be very friendly but is unorganized. I once had a reservation on a week night and he did not put a large table aside for our party of 6- instead he had us sitting separately waiting for other parties to leave. \\xc2\\xa0It was awkward and annoying.

I went with friends on a Friday evening, so I dunno if it's like this at other times (looks like more neg reviews for the brunch crowd), but it was a pretty okay scene as far as ambiance or whatever and my group took major advantage of the BYOB policy and brought a shit ton of alc.

My appetizer was the Tuscan Chicken (chicken stuffed with spinach&ricotta with a sauce on top), which came with chive mashed potatoes and mixed greens. It was very good, and I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for chicken. My boyfriend got the Steak Frites, which come with Rosemary Fries and mixed greens. Steak came out as it should have been cooked. What I must absolutely recommend is the Rosemary Fries, and it is definitely something everyone should get when eating there. They're cooked to a delicious crisp, and you do get the hint of rosemary. The mixed greens are good as well because they come with this house balsamic vinaigrette that I loved (if only I knew the recipe to it!).

The beans were watery, very salty, flavorless, and the service, especially delivery, was just awful. I ordered over the phone, in Spanish, since it seems to be easier, and even after I repeated the order twice, I was delivered the wrong thing. Moreover, the delivery boy, Oscar I think his name was, was very inappropriate. Not only was he asking me questions like how much money I make and if I'm married, he smelled of something terrible.

I have sat at both the dinning room and the bar and received excellent/friendly service from Steve (manager) and Alyssa at a table as well as Liam at the bar. Food wise, I have had almost everything on their seasonal menu and have eaten almost every last bite for each dish. Their burger is amazing and they make some kick-ass pastas. They have a fantastic cocktail menu and Liam at the bar is not afraid to go off menu and make something specified to your tastes. My only complaint is the prices are a bit high.

We could see the waitstaff making half-assed, sluggish attempts to put the tables together, but it was clear that they were just totally incompetent. Incidentally, the cocktail that I had while we were waiting was terrible. I think it was the Van Helsing. Then when we were FINALLY seated, in a table back in the main room, which was incredibly dark and loud, we were overcame with heat.

Also, I'm not a fan of pickles and was surprised to find them in my wrap. The pita was the best part of the wrap to be honest- it was soft but not chewy. The fact that I did not eat the wrap right away or the very hot weather might have played a role in my sub par eating experience, but I also suspect that the falafels I was served were not fresh (I was told to wait a few minutes for falafels and saw one worker putting more in the oil and just a second later, my wrap was ready, before the freshly dropped ones were fetched from the oil).

They\\'re freakin\\' -filthy-! Dude. I don\\'t give a damn about eating food off a street cart, or tamales made by some old Spanish lady\\'s bare hands, or rice cakes cooked by some Chinese woman in a store front that\\'s the size of my closet. That\\'s normally great, authentic, culturally rich food. And I\\'ve eaten some very questionable food in my time.

The problem here is that none of these dudes changed their gloves once. I saw them stick their hands in raw falafel mix, handle cash money, and the -worst- offense, handle a filthy garbage container covered in wet rancid scrap-food mess to dump it into the nasty C-town dumpster a few yards away. AND NEVER CHANGED THEIR GLOVES. And then! stick their hands in a basket of cooked falafel to hand it as samples to people waiting on line! Wtf! I didn\\'t finish my chicken platter the night I got it because: a) It was very filling and b) I was busy peeing out of my ass after eating it. BUT. Just to convey how delicious the food was, I STILL ate some of the left overs the next day because: a) It was delicious b) Someone stole my lunch at work and I didn\\'t eat anything all day. Famished, I risked it a second time. Yes, stupid, my fault, and like damn clockwork I found myself pooping out everything I just consumed. On the plus side, this could be a really great diet. You get to eat amazing food and dump it all out before your body gets to absorb any calories. Seriously, if it wasn\\'t for their complete lack of hygienic practices, this place would easily be five stars.

I used to live near this cart and bought food from it several times a week, never got tired of it. Its pricier than other carts, $6 for the basic chicken and rice dish and $10 for the lamb chops, pricey but you get excellent food.

I had their beef and chicken plate (Freddy Junior) and found it tasty but it does not compare to their Chicken and Rice. That plate is money. The mix of rice (either basmati or yellow) with Chicken, salad, tomatoes, pickled turnips along with their hot sauce and white sauce it the most amazing combination. Top that off with a delicious falafel and you just can't go wrong. I've had my share of falafel carts and this is by far the best. In addition, Freddy is amazingly friendly and has a great memory. I saw him greet a customer that hadn't stopped by in a year! That's how devoted he is to his customers.

       " 'David Bouley Reneges on Gift Certificate Donation Dined at Bouley this summer and although the food, decor and the whole Bouley experience was what one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber, it is not likely I would ever go back. \\xc2\\xa0I felt I was treated poorly and condescendingly at the restaurant. \\xc2\\xa0This was not just by the staff but by Mr. Bouley himself. \\xc2\\xa0The incident involved a gift certificate I had won at a charity event for Pediatric Cancer. \\xc2\\xa0It seems the restaurant did not recognize the certificate although I referred to it when I made the reservation, confirmed the reservation and upon my arrival at the restaurant. \\xc2\\xa0It was only during dessert that I was \\xc2\\xa0informed of the problem. \\xc2\\xa0It put the damper on a lovely evening and so I asked for Mr. Bouley\\'s email address in order to make a formal complaint. \\xc2\\xa0I was told that Mr. Bouley does not do email but he requested that I should go to the kitchen to meet with him. \\xc2\\xa0Dressed as you can imagine I was, I was not inclined to go to the kitchen. \\xc2\\xa0Mr. Bouley came out and instead of suggesting that perhaps he take a swipe of my credit card and we could sort it all out in the morning, proceeded to tell me in front of my guests that we should understand that people try to scam him all the time. \\xc2\\xa0When asked to explain why we were not informed about the \"irregular\" charity certificate, he blamed it on the inexperience of his staff as if that were my problem. \\xc2\\xa0Doesn\\'t the price of the meal include competent staff? \\xc2\\xa0And shouldn\\'t you give your customers the benefit of the doubt that they are not scamming you considering they have just spent well over the amount of the gift certificate? \\xc2\\xa0Mr. Bouley did not handle this well and his ego was enormous. \\xc2\\xa0After treating us as if we were begging him for charity instead of patronizing his restaurant, he thought a complimentary glass of champagne would make it all OK. \\xc2\\xa0It did not. \\xc2\\xa0All of us at the table had been to Bouley before and although we do not regularly dine in that fashion (we do not manage hedge funds), we do dine that way a number of times a year and there are many restaurants in the city of this caliber. \\xc2\\xa0I could easily take my business to a different restaurant the next time and recommend others do the same.',\n",
       " 'I had the pleasure of dining at David Bouley on 9/1/14 or at least I thought it would be a pleasurable experience. On arrival my wife and I were greeted and were told that our table was almost ready. So we took a seat close to the door, and when the pompous ma\\xc3\\xaetre \\'d appeared, he looked at us, and then looked over his seating chart. He \\xc2\\xa0had a young lady seat us rather than do it himself as he had just seated the customer before us. After passing by many available tables upstairs, I noticed that we were heading to the back of the restaurant and down the stairs to a small dining room that was nicely appointed; however, little did we know but we had just been relegated to the \"David Bouley Dungeon for Tourists.\" \\xc2\\xa0As one who has dined all over the world, I started to say something, but bit tongue and looked forward to a great wine and food experience. From here we went down hill. I asked for the wine list and with the help of the sommelier,we chose a half bottle of a small grower champagne and a half bottle of an 09 Burgundy. Interestingly, both bottles were retrieved by the sommelier and shown to me while he held them in one hand. The champagne was immediately tasted and served and the Burgundy was tasted. While toasting our champagne the sommelier started pouring the Burgundy which startled me; however, I chose to keep quiet and wait on the food. (By pouring both wines either the sommelier was either trying to sell me more wines or he just did not want to come back to the dungeon again to serve the Burg. To my chagrin, it was both.) So now we settle in for the great dinner. It was anything but that. We chose not to have the tasting menu and ordered a la carte from the menu. We both chose the wild mushrooms with Toro. Both appetizers were barely warm at best and my wife\\'s Toro was fishy. Again we still had faith but told the waiter about the Toro. When the waiter tried to tell us that the Toro tasted that way, I could not hold my tongue any longer, and let the waiter know that I had eaten Toro many times in Japan and stateside, and if fresh, it does not taste fishy. He later came back and said it was because of the marinade--I just shook my head at his comment. Next my wife had the salmon, and I had the duck prepared as Chef saw best. To say the least when I took my first bite, the dish was barely warm again. At that point I confronted the waiter, that I thought David Bouley was suppose \\xc2\\xa0to be a great restaurant, and that \\xc2\\xa0it was obvious to me that the Chef was not even at the restaurant. The duck was quickly removed, and I was asked if I would like another dish. I was reluctant, but agreed to the striped bass which was prepared perfectly and was served nice and hot. By the time my dish was served, my wife\\'s salmon was cold and now needed to be warmed. It did however come back quickly. (On a good note, I was not charged for the duck or bass; however, to get something free at DB was not my intention, I came to have a great dining experience.) \\xc2\\xa0To make up for all the issues, we were plied with deserts. Thanks but no thanks--I do not need all the sugar and my wife did not care for desert that night. So that was our night at David Bouley which I will never set foot in again as I consider it not a good restaurant. However, on the whole, the service was good but you cannot eat the service. The sommelier obviously was over serving the wine and certainly did not want to return to the dungeon. Per the food, well my review speaks for that abomination. The ma\\xc3\\xaetre d\\' at the front of the house is pompous and appears to only greet and seat those he knows; however, on leaving, I thought I was his best friend--I just turned around and gave him \"the look.\" Also, I never once saw him show his face in the dungeon. Lastly, if you are from out of town, insure you are \\xc2\\xa0not seated in the dungeon where I believe you are not treated as the patrons upstairs. New York has too many great restaurants to chance getting a mediocre food \\xc2\\xa0and wine experience as we had at David Bouley. \\xc2\\xa0 Bill Nunnelly',\n",
       " 'We were looking forward to an amazing dinner at Bouley to celebrate our marriage. We were less than impressed. The lobster was cold and overcooked. I ate only a few bites but was never asked if it was OK before it was cleared away. \\xc2\\xa0The service was average. And I agree with the review about feeling uncomfortable in the restaurant. \\xc2\\xa0I would never recommend this less than average restaurant to anyone. And, at $150 per person, you can do much better in NYC than this stuffy restaurant.',\n",

After attempting another Resturant in town (btw they went out of their way to make us happy and was wonderful, we had a drink and appetizer, but was too loud and crowded) we moved along to Bouley later in the evening for a light dinner. My husband ordered the duck. I ordered a salad. Our server advised the captain and we were then told in a very haughty way \"The chef insists you must order an entree.\" \\xc2\\xa0Not that it matters but, the salad was $25.00. \\xc2\\xa0Also, there were no vegetarian options. I was forced to order an entree but I canceled the salad. The fish came and was under cooked but my husbands duck was great. Now, we would have had another glass of champagne, coffee and dessert so not sure what the point of it all was. They made 21.00 extra dollars out of it all by pressing the issue but lost out on a lot more in the end.',\n",

The service was unfortunately poor - wine not being poured; our wine with main course arrived as I ate my last mouthful of my dish; a dessert was delivered that wasn't ordered; despite informing staff of an allergy petits-fours arrived containing the offending item without any warning. The sommelier when asked for wine recommendations did indeed offer suggestions however on the more expensive side.

       " 'Having been to many of the top rated restaurants in New York City, I was looking forward to eating at Bouley, rated 2nd for food in Zagat. Unfortunately, I left quite disappointed with the experience. I had the special lunch menu of five courses...none were a culinary \"wow\". Although the quality of each ingredient was superb, I felt that the somewhat exotic additions to each dish resulted in less than wonderful flavors. Please note I welcome creative cusine; I simply feel Bouley\\'s attempts at modernity did not work. Service was also less than expected for a restaurant of this reputation. We waited more than 5 minutes after being seated before anyone came to to take our orders. I ran out of water midway through the meal; no one came to refill it until I was almost finished with the dessert course. We had several waiters bring courses,and we were never served by the lady who originally took our orders. I find this odd. I actually wish I could give Bouley a 3.5 rating. Needless to say, I do not intend to return to this restaurant.',\n",

       " 'Upon arrival at the restaurant, we were greeted at the gorgeous coat check room by the aroma of fresh apples. \\xc2\\xa0As we were escorted into the highly ornate dining room, we felt the staff was slightly stuffy and pretentious, but that feeling would eventually dissipate as mistakes were made by the staff, and unprofessional behavior was observed. \\xc2\\xa0 We had a 6:00 pm reservation, so as soon as we sat, the complimentary amuse came right away. \\xc2\\xa0We were surprised that the food came so fast, especially when we have not even looked at the menu or ordered yet. \\xc2\\xa0Between the two of us, we ordered one 6-course tasting menu (4 savory and 2 dessert) and one a la carte menu. \\xc2\\xa0So here are the details of what we ate: -Porcini Flan, Dungeness Crab, Truffle Dashi: Probably the best dish of the night, the \"flan\" was made in a traditional tasting chawanmushi, with freshly picked crab. \\xc2\\xa0The menu said Porcini flan, but we had a difficult time finding any porcini here. \\xc2\\xa0Could be infused in the flan? -Wild Mushrooms, Toro, Truffle Dressing: \\xc2\\xa0 With a combination of Maitake, Porcini, Oyster Mushroom, Enoki and what looked like mousseron mushrooms, this was another delicious dish. \\xc2\\xa0The menu says Toro on it, but no one at the restaurant explained what type of fish this \"toro\" came from. \\xc2\\xa0As an additional comment, I can\\'t imagine all the mushrooms on this dish is actually \"wild\" with the exception of the porcini and mousseron mushrooms. \\xc2\\xa0 -French Wild Turbot: The menu had no description on the garnish of this dish, so I asked the captain when he took the order. \\xc2\\xa0He explained that it had pinenuts, squash puree, porcini. \\xc2\\xa0He also said that it was pan roasted. \\xc2\\xa0When this dish came out, the back server described that it was hearts of palm on the dish, when it actually was a slice of porcini on top. \\xc2\\xa0In addition, the turbot seemed to have been poached or steamed instead of pan roasted. \\xc2\\xa0 -Pistachio-Miso Marinated Black Cod: A riff on the classic Japanese dish of miso marinated cod, the fish on the dish was excellent, and cooked well. -New England Black Sea Bass, Beets, Turnips, Rutabaga: Another great dish, combining diced rutabaga and beets, with a puree of Japanese turnips, which the captain mistakenly described as \"almond foam.\" -Long Island Duck, Dates, Polenta, Huckleberry: I\\'ve had many great duck dishes and this was not one of the best one. \\xc2\\xa0First of all, it was poorly cooked. \\xc2\\xa0The skin side of the breast seemed to have been seared too long as half the flesh on the duck was grey and over cooked, while the bone side of the breast meat was still a medium-rare. \\xc2\\xa0The date puree underneath provided a nice sweetness to the dish, but I could not find anything resembling a huckleberry on it. \\xc2\\xa0 -Lychee Sorbet, Clementines: A refreshing palate cleanser, delicious and straight forward. -Pineapple Souffle: A souffle with diced pineapples and a pistachio \"soup\" on the bottom. \\xc2\\xa0I thought this was too sweet for my taste, and the souffle itself was a little soupy as well. \\xc2\\xa0A dish that I would probably not order again. \\xc2\\xa0 So that was my description of the dishes we had. \\xc2\\xa0Overall, we enjoyed most of the savory courses, and thought the desserts were overall too sweet. \\xc2\\xa0The staff were overall friendly, but thought they could have more knowledge of the food, given the \\xc2\\xa0discrepancies in the food descriptions. \\xc2\\xa0The bread service on the cart was also a great addition to the dining experience here, with a delicious assortment of fresh baked breads. \\xc2\\xa0The dining room here was beautiful and we would come back for the decor alone. \\xc2\\xa0 At the very end, as we walked out of the restaurant, we peered into the window from outside which looked into the kitchen. \\xc2\\xa0It is always exciting to see the kitchen at work, but as we were watching, a front of the house staff, who looked like a busser or kitchen server, was coming to the sink to drop off dirty dishes. \\xc2\\xa0As he was doing so, he looked me in the eye and continued to eat something off of the dirty plates that just came back from the guest\\'s table. \\xc2\\xa0We thought that this was disgusting and completely unprofessional, especially knowing that he is being watched. \\xc2\\xa0This act by this one person completely ruined our impression of the restaurant, and makes you think what else could be going on when they are NOT being watched. Overall, we give the restaurant\\'s decor 5 stars, the food 3.5 stars, and the service with the unprofessional behavior 2 stars, giving it an average of 3.5 stars.',\n",

Before you go to Bouley my advice is to check the menu carefully (in all fairness not our ideal menu,) expect the possibility of aspects of the food not being great and before you drop 500 beans for two people insist on sitting in the main dining room.\",\n",

The rest of the meal was just okay. I would go back again though. Bouley is such a charming place, with impeccable service and grace.

I had the chocolate cake for dessert and that was such a treat. My only down side was it took them a while to get us our food; the wait staff was a bit slow and perhaps the kitchen was backed up so that's why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.

But when my date arrived and we entered the main restaurant I saw a lot more younger people and it had a bit more energy as well. We had the table near the back that had both seats facing the same direction which always kind of annoys me, especially tonight since my date was lookin so good.

They gave us two (one for each of us) of the Porcini Flan (this was the recommended appetizer dish), we also highly recommend it. We also had the North Carolina Pink Shrimp & Cape Cod Sea Scallops. The main courses were amazing too, we had the veal and lobster both were amazing. The dessert was even better, they also gave us an additional dish with dessert.

This speaks volumes of the chef's dedication to not just making the food taste divine, but to catering to his client's every nuance so their dining experience is unforgettable. Inexpensive it is not, but that is okay because this is not a restaurant to be taken lightly. You need to dress properly and be prepared for a meal that has more flavors then you thought could really exist.

There were 8 other people, and about half of us were vegetarian, and they did an excellent job accommodating our restrictions. We did the lunch tasting menu, and again, everything was very, very good. It's so difficult to find different, inventive vegetarian food, and Bouley really hit the spot. We dined in the basement, which wasn't as nice at it is upstairs. Decorations were pretty spare, and the noise level was so low because there were so few diners there that the nine of us felt pretty awkward talking at normal conversational levels. As we left, the upstairs level was quite bustling, so I think it was just the basement. The Peach soup pre-dessert was the most phenomenal thing I have ever tasted (and quite frankly, was better than the actual desert). Random Tip: For upscale restaurant newbies like my friends and I, when they give you the options for water, there's a $7/bottle charge (we drank about 9 bottles worth), if you ask for bottled water. Of course, in hindsight, it was silly to assume that there wouldn't be a charge, but I guess we just weren't as mindful as we should have been!\",\n",

We will highly recommend the Tasting menu; everything was cooked to perfection (Porcini Flan was phenomenal). The bread trolly was awesome; while the olive bread was my fiance's favorite, I couldn't get enough of the apricot bread. Desserts were fabulous too, especially the complimentary one made of frothy chocolate (sorry can't remember the name). Decor is very intimate and romantic but that shouldn't stop families and big groups from a 5 star dining experience. Entrance is wonderfully decorated with shelves of apples and the ladies restroom is quite interesting as well. \\xc2\\xa0Bouley is definitely going to be our restaurant to celebrate special occasions.\",\n",

We selected the tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food was absolutely delicious and we enjoyed the special wine selections. I enjoyed not only the taste of all of the dishes, but the presentation as well. In addition to the 5 courses, there were several surprise courses added along the way. And the bread cart--wow! Over 10 choices of delicious, homemade bread. The restaurant is gorgeous; our table looked out at a painting of lavender fields, which brought back memories of a trip to France. In addition to the food and wine, the service is truly outstanding--attentive, without being overbearing, and attuned to every need. They were very accommodating of my dietary restrictions and were careful not to serve anything I couldn\\'t eat. Even though it was lunch, we were so full when we left that we didn\\'t eat until the next day. And they surprised us with a special \"happy anniversary\" message at dessert--such a perfect end to a wonderful afternoon.

I am not going to recommend anything on the menu because as often as my girlfriend and I go we have never had a sub-par dish. The ambiance is cossetting, warm and embracing.

His artistry begins with the incredible rolls. Then the apricot walnut bread is to die for, not to mention the fig bread and the dried cherry bread. He seems to be using more organic ingredients. Last visit for example, one of our two desserts on the $55.00 five course lunch tasting menu, organic strawberries in an ameretto mousse which was amazing. The duck was melt the mouth delicious. The porcini mushroom flan was loaded with crabmeat and better than ever. The oysters tasted of caught ten minutes ago freshness. And the chocolate souffle was its usual amazing self. This meal coupled with our amazing Christmas Day lunch in 2011 prompted me to pump them up to five stars, but the service which was spectacular on Christmas Day 2011 left alot to be desired at lunch a couple of weeks ago.',\n",

       " 'I wend to this restaurant a few months back with family. It was an overall excellent experience: from the service to the food, even the waiting area was unique with the rows of apples (which everyone seem to mention in their reviews as well). The choices for artisan bread complemented the excellent tasting menu. I definitely recommend choosing the flan, even if a supplement will be necessary. Though the prohibitive price makes the restaurant somewhat harder to approach, the satisfaction from eating at such a dressy place is unparalleled. I always use to say, you can truly tell how good a restaurant is by the quality of its bathroom, and this one definitely earns 5 stars.',\n",
       " \"Wonderful food (the six course tasting menu is fantastic for dinner!), the best wine I've ever had thanks to one of the best sommeliers at any restaurant I've ever visited, the most comfortable and beautiful room, and friendly and efficient service add up to one of the best restaurant experiences of my life. I've dined at anywhere from Per Se to Jean-Georges to Daniel to Le Bernardin, and Bouley is definitely in my top 3 restaurants. I always feel so comfortable and welcomed here, the food is consistently excellent (if not quite at the level of Jean-Georges), and the room feels like I've been transported to some crazy French chateau. Bathrooms are super fancy, too. I make sure to visit the men's room here at least three times just to take advantage.If you're looking to eat one of the best meals of your life and be treated like a king for two and a half hours, look no further than this unlabeled wonderland on Hudson and Reade.\",\n",

Everything was delicious and promptly served. In particular the black cod, the salmon, and even something as simple as a Boston Bibb salad were exquisitely prepared. The bread service was a novel and tasty treat. The attention to detail about everything was top notch, nothing was overlooked.

       " 'My friend Cici and I love a great deal, so we decided to go for the $55 prix-fixe 5 course lunch at Bouley today. The restaurant was beautiful, with fresh flowers everywhere. \\xc2\\xa0Cici commented that the waiters were serving like a well-rehearsed symphony. Once in awhile, you would get a whiff of truffles. The lunch started with an amuse bouche: pumpkin soup with candied pine nuts. It reminded me of the soup I used to buy at the now closed Bouley Market. The soup was so creamy and pumpkin-y that I wished Bouley Market is still open. For our first course, we both chose the Carpaccio Of Kampachi, Young Blue Fin Tuna And Striped Amber Jack prepared in a mediterranean manne. \\xc2\\xa0The plate was so pretty, it looked like fish swimming in a pool of pretty green flowers. \\xc2\\xa0The carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh with the most wonderful sauces. We were fascinated by the guy wheeling around the bread in a cart like one of those dim sum ladies. He was so into methodically cutting the bread that he belonged in a movie about Bouley, or bread, or just any movie. He suggested the Saffron walnut bread with the porcini flan. I also tried the apricot walnut bread (sweet, chewy and fresh) and olive bread. I still think Del Posto has the best bread in the city though. The second course was the famous Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab black truffle dashi in its own little pot. \\xc2\\xa0I can see why so many people recommend the flan. The crab meat was outrageously crabby and fresh. \\xc2\\xa0I believe this dish is what makes the air smell like truffles every once in awhile, when someone is served the porcini flan and they open the little pot and let the aroma envelop them (an apparently everyone else) in a cloud of truffle bliss. For the third course, Cici picked the All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken with carrot ravioli, chanterelles, pain d\\'empics dressing and I picked the Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks with blue kale gnocchi. \\xc2\\xa0 Cici gave me a bite of her chicken and carrot ravioli. This was not the usual frozen chicken you get at other restaurants. I want, no NEED, the secret of how they make the chicken so tender. \\xc2\\xa0Is it because it\\'s all natural or from Pennsylvania? \\xc2\\xa0We need to know. This chicken was so tender, it makes other so called \"chicken tenders\" taste like leather (Cici said \"old shoe\" but I\\'m not as gross as her). \\xc2\\xa0\"They are like chicken meltaways!\" Cici later texted me as she finished her chicken that she took home in a doggie bag (more on that later). \\xc2\\xa0 Also, the carrot raviloli was so sweet and the pasta delectible, it tasted like pumpkin. \\xc2\\xa0(Before this, my only other taste of a sweet vegetable ravioli are the butternut squash raviolis at Costco. \\xc2\\xa0This aint no Costco ravioli, people! \\xc2\\xa0I am not a snob, I just like good food.) \\xc2\\xa0 The beef was delicious as well, with gnocchi on the bottom, but by then I was too full to fully appreciate the beef, however yummy it was. Next, came a palate cleanser of Honey Tangerine Soup with sancho pepper, lychee sorbet, crystallized honey. \\xc2\\xa0Very refreshing and perfect after all the courses. We both picked the Hot Caramilized Anjou Pear,valrhona chocolate, biscuit breton, hot toffee sauce, lemon verbena and tahitian vanilla ice creams for dessert. \\xc2\\xa0I did not like the lemon verbena ice cream too much, reminded me of Lemon Pledge. \\xc2\\xa0Sorry. \\xc2\\xa0The chef provided us an extra dessert: bulgur wheat ice cream. It was a unique taste, creamy and kind of salty. The chef also presented some complimentary, gorgeous little macarons, wafer thin cookies, chocolates and nut crunch. \\xc2\\xa0 We did not finish our desserts so we asked for doggie bags. The server who cleared the table acted like this was an unusual request. Yes, we are Hoi polloi. \\xc2\\xa0We take doggie bags. We are not on a date and we don\\'t care. Plus, it\\'s a Michelin Star doggie bag. If you think we are declasse for asking for doggie bags, witness what happened at the next table: The two guys next to us (not in jackets, as required by the restaurant rules) obviously tourists due to the hotel room key card on the table (see, no little detail escapes me, a skill I honed after watching almost all the Monk reruns), sat down later than us, so by the time their table was cleared for dessert, we were done with our meal. \\xc2\\xa0One of the guys (with an accent) asked for *gasp* more bread. \\xc2\\xa0The server said incredulously, \"More bread, with DESSERT?\" \\xc2\\xa0Amateurs. \\xc2\\xa0Tourists. \\xc2\\xa0Didn\\'t they know that we New Yawkers don\\'t eat bread with dessert? \\xc2\\xa0Suddenly, it was as if the perfect symphony came to a screeching halt for a second. \\xc2\\xa0The bread guy was notified of the request, and he went over and asked which bread they would like to enjoy some more. \\xc2\\xa0They chose the apricot walnut (good choice). \\xc2\\xa0Bread Guy said, \"Let me get you a plate, would you like butter with that?\" \\xc2\\xa0Then all was well again as the two bread-loving gentlemen were served their desserts. \\xc2\\xa0The doggie bags were discreetly given to us by the receptionist/coat check girl. \\xc2\\xa0Go to my blog for more of this review.',\n",

One server pushed around a bread cart with 6 different wonderful breads to try and I overdid it. Dessert was sublime--a hot caramelized pear with toffee sauce and ice cream. \\xc2\\xa0 I felt like I was having lunch in a welcoming, elegant home. \\xc2\\xa0Our group of five people had cocktails, a bottle of wine and the full 5-course tasting menu. \\xc2\\xa0It came to $110 a person including a 20% tip. \\xc2\\xa0The lunch was worth every penny. \\xc2\\xa0Absolutely loved it. \\xc2\\xa0 I'm from San Francisco and my friends can be kind of snarky and find faults with lots of things.

I really don't have anything to add to how fantastic the $175 tasting menu was. They kept feeding us with wonderful cookies and dessert just because it was our wedding anniversary until we were so full and needed a break! One thing I remember was I was on my way to the ladies' room, and the head waiter stopped the traffic in the hallway for me so that I could make it safely to the bathroom. His gesture made me feel like a queen! I ordered a book written by Danny Meyer for a friend today who wants to start a restaurant. DM opened Shake Shack, restaurants at the Museum of Modern Art, restaurants that haven been around so long, they became institutions. DM talks about how the service is so important.

The fried chicken here was delicious. They incorporate sweet tea & lemon with a light breading and tender juicy chicken. It makes for a deadly combo. The menu is very inventive with new takes on old southern favorites. We tried a few different items and enjoyed each of them. I also recommend taking a look at the cocktail list. The drinks are well crafted and offer great flavor without being overpowering.\",\n",

Each time my boyfriend and I go, we order half of a bucket of bird, the mac and cheese, and whatever else we feel like having. The deviled eggs are a MUST!

       " 'I visited Root & Bone this past Tuesday after reading about it in one of my many NYC emails! I am always intrigued by a fried chicken joint, so I knew I had to go. Unfortunately, similar to some of the reviews I\\'m seeing, I had a bad experience with the reservation. I called two weeks ago to make a reservation for that current week and was told that they were booked. I then made a reservation for the following week. Tuesday rolled around and I had not received a confirmation so I called them to confirm. No one picked up so I left a message. By that afternoon, I still hadn\\'t received a call back, so I called again. I spoke with someone and told her my name time of the reservation and the # of people in the party. I said I was just calling to confirm and she said \"Yep\". Shame on me for taking this \"Yep\" as a \"yes, your reservation is confirmed\" Upon arrival I was told they did not have my reservation. At the same time a gentleman came out from the dining area with a raised voice about the confusion with seating for his party. He demanded that they move the people that they just put in his seats. Lastly, a person who came in right after me and allegedly had a reservation received the same response, that there was nothing on file for them either. I spoke with the manager and she was able to seat me and my guest at the bar in front of the kitchen within 20 minutes. Though I my chair was practically blocking the bathroom door. Luckily this did not become a disgusting situation but it certainly could have. Needless to say, they really need to work on their organization skills and their seating and reservation process. Okay, on to the good stuff! Both the food, and the speed at which is came out was fantastic and impressive given their other issues. We ordered the fried chicken (the whole bird), the cornbread, the waffles, and the mac and cheese. I have not a complaint about any of these foods, they were all excellent. The fried chicken was exactly as it is being described in other reviews, crispy and light but so juicy and delicious. I\\'m not a particular fan of dark meat so I would say that the legs were a little \"bleh\" but the chicken breasts were out of this world. The fried outside has a lemony thyme seasoning on it that is so refreshing. The cornbread which comes with a creamy spread and a rhubarb jam of some sort was also great. This came out first for us to nosh on. No complaints here. The waffles were 4 smaller but thick waffles covered in a slice of cheese (not sure what kind). They were accompanied by some kind of whiskey syrup that was really interesting and good. I didn\\'t get too into the waffles because I had the corn bread. The mac and cheese was not warm enough when it came out, but they just sent it back for us and gave us a new one that was very hot. It was creamy but not too flavorful, I think this is okay given how the chicken really steals the show. It was topped with breadcrumbs which gave a nice crunch. Very thick and creamy. My friend ordered a Arnold Palmer but the waiter forgot about it. After she reminded him again he was more attentive and asked her if she wanted a refill. Overall I would say the food was delicious, the service worked out okay, and I would go back when they get their stuff together a bit more. I would like to try the dessert next time but we were too full! Please definitely go check them out if you love fried chicken, but you may want to wait a few more weeks until they settle.',\n",

No eye contact, arms in front of the heart all time, not answering basic questions about the wines on the board, trying to avoid the contact with customers, instead of engaging with them... I wanted to leave, when the manager that I called, was kind enough to move me to another part of the restaurant even if I was alone. She didn't seem though to have decided to take action against him, and she looked almost scared because she said that he was there for long time and untouchable... No more there with that Steve!\",\n",

For antipasto, I had arancini, which my nonna could make better, fried ricotta which was nice, salumi which were \\xc2\\xa0disappointing. For pasta, I tasted all of the dishes that had a tomato sauce, and the sauce for all was not very good. I also had the pasta with mint and fava beans which was unappetizing. For the main course, I had pollo alla diavola which was moist but not spicy at all. I also had roasted potatoes on the side which was overly sweet. Overall, if you want to spend alot of money on small portions and roman food that is not very good, then come to maialino, because you will leave with a empty wallet and a empty stomach',\n",
       " \"Danny Meyer may know how to run a four star restaurant but I question his [or his staff's] ability to select comfortable bar stools. That was just the beginning to a somewhat shaky first meal experience at his new Gramercy Park 'Roman Italian' eatery attached to the over-indulgent Gramercy Park Hotel. The chairs are, in a word, uncomfortable and while there are quite a few of them, I'm sure I'm not the only person who has found them slippery, confining and downright uncomfortable. But I digress. I came in looking for some terrific pasta and what I should have done is head over to 9th avenue and found a red sauce spaghetti house that's good, cheap and knows what comfortable seating is all about. But I didn't. And here's why: If Danny Meyer owns/runs something, it's suppose to be good - very good. So I allowed the reputation to get ahead of the meal and ended up at one of the bar area communal tables for dinner. Mistake. My food was okay; not terrific. The sauce was a bit too creamy and a bit too peppery. Believe me, I ate it all. But the downer was the lack of attention from the waitstaff [something mentioned in other reviews] at the bar. No salt. No pepper. No follow-up to see if it was good. Just a plate of pasta, an inquiry about my interest in dessert and the check. After an hour, I was ready to leave. Will I come back? Perhaps - but not to sit in the bar area... the people in the dining room looked like they were having much more fun.\",\n",

       " \"This restaurant is the best part of the Gramercy Park Hotel. \\xc2\\xa0Although the starters were excellent, \\xc2\\xa0I could not understand why my dining partner raved over his pasta dish. \\xc2\\xa0It was simple, homestyle food that did not warrant the high price. \\xc2\\xa0I'm open to tasting more dishes at the restaurant, but can't say I'm dying to head back. \\xc2\\xa0 The wine selection, however, made both of us happy, as did our server, who was friendly and not overbearing.\",\n",

And while the hostess was apologetic, I thought it would have been a much nicer touch if she'd actually offered us a glass of wine on the house for our inconvenience, which I think is something most restaurants tend to do. It would have been especially appreciated it in this case, considering we racked up quite a nice bill in the Rose Bar while we waited, where cocktails are $20 a pop. Don't get the fig and ricotta crostini. They had sort of a medicinal aftertaste which we couldn't totally identify. The rest of the food was good enough, but my bucatini al amatriciana was only okay compared to the insane, go-blind-from-deliciousness version at Lupa (where you also get more of it). Our water glasses remained empty for much of the evening, which is a personal peeve of mine. As typically devoted Danny Meyer fans, we were disappointed.\",\n",

However I was extremely disappointed at bar today. When I ordered a glass of champagne, a bartender gave me a glass of prosecco instead. It was not even a mistake (I wish it was). I believed he assumed I would not know the difference. For the restaurant with that level, I do not think it is acceptable. It is pretty unfortunate and I don't' think I can't take my people anymore as I do not want to be embarrassed. Again it's enjoyable but please be careful and make sure that you get what you order.\",\n",

I am obsessed with spaghetti carbonara, and HAD to get that the particular day we went. So yummy, and totally hit the spot. My friend got the raviolo al uovo--he's obsessed with eggs, but while this dish tasted delish, it was a small portion and not very satisfying. We also tried the suckling pig ragu which was rich and complex and so delicious. The frittata blanca which my cousin got was pretty disappointing and unexciting. so overall, 2 for 4, which is not a great average. But the whole ambiance was comforting and inviting, and I have a feeling I'll be coming back to try other things on the menu\",\n",

It was a big undertaking at 90 bucks, but he ensured us that it will feed the four of us. He also told us about how we can order a side of extra parts, like pork shoulder and cheak for an extra price. To me this was one of the best parts of the meal, and we wouldn't have thought to get it without his suggestion. Before it was brought out to us, a waiter brought the pig to the table before it was cooked, asking our approval as if it were an uncorked bottle of wine. I was very immpressed. When it was served, it turned out to be one of the best things I've ever tasted, it was one of those meals you will just never forget. The skin was so crispy and about an inch thick. Under that skin was the most tender, juicy pork I've ever eaten. I'm no chef but I swear it had to have been slow cooked for days, for weeks! For dessert we ordered one of my favorites- affogato, and the waiter came out to poor the espresso over the creamy vanilla gilato himself. Again, impressed. Another point to make about the service - I tweeted at the restaurantseveral times, expressing my excitement for the meal to come, and they responded almost immediatly each time, to the delight of me and my dining buddies. This was on a busy holiday weekend night. This may be a bit dramatic but at the end of the night I actually hugged the waiter. I will never forget this night, this meal and this restaurant. Between the service, the atmosphere, the drinks and the food, it's a NYC gem.\",\n",

When I do see a seat (or two), I walk in, grab it, order a glass of bubbly and wait for my companion (whom I've texted as I grab the seat) to arrive and join me in this completely spontaneous meal/treat. Anywho, my favorite go-to dishes at Maialino are the octopus, Maialino's very own mortadella, and almost any of the pasta dishes depending on my mood. The mortadella is basically a bologne - but a million times more delicious. \\xc2\\xa0I often imagine myself making a mortadella sandwich with 2 pieces of white Wonder Bread and wondering what it would taste like. \\xc2\\xa0I decide that with Maialino's mortadella, of course, that no condiment is necessary because it is THAT good. \\xc2\\xa0 The 'polpo', or the octopus, is succulent, charred and delicious and it's dressing of citrus and veggies make the dish perfect. My go to pasta dish is any one of their versions with sausage in it; or the carbonara, the cacio e pepe, or the bucatini all'amatriciana. \\xc2\\xa0Along with my pasta, I often order their veggie sides because whomever is cooking up the veggie sides is doing a crazy good job at it. \\xc2\\xa0You don't like your veggies? \\xc2\\xa0GET the veggies here and you'll be in love with veggies - well seasoned, garlicky deliciousness.

Originally from France, I'm keen of high gastronomy and Palo Santo's cuisine easily bear comparison with very good restaurants in Paris (such as Thierry Marx', Agape substance, Ghislaine Arabian's, etc.). I have been amazingly surprised by the quality of the products they use, their freshness and their passion in creating a deep, heartfelt, captivating and unique set of flavors and textures. They change the menu daily, and that's for me the paramount key for good cuisine. Their creativity and their savoir-faire impressed and are still impressing me. My most memorable dishes were the steak perfectly balanced and seasoned with tobacco and red-eye gravy (a must-taste discovery), tortilla avocado, slow cooked pork (it melted slowly and smoothly in my mouth, and was indeed delicious), and ceviche. Their wine menu is impeccable! The waiters are always very patient and attentive to make you discover some new variety of wine.

During the actual event, the staff were attentive and even set up a folding table for the gifts. Food: Far and away the best part about Palo Santo is the INCREDIBLE food. We had three main course options: papusas, french toast, and the tortilla cubanas - and each was more delicious and unique than the next. For sides we had a salad and plantains - equally delicious. Everyone in our group raved about the food. \\xc2\\xa0The coffee, fresh squeezed OJ, sangria, and mimosas topped it off. Atmosphere: Palo Santo is one of the more charming locations I have ever been to. In the first floor of a brownstone, there is plenty of natural light and you feel like you are in your own dining room (albeit a much nicer version). We had a long table in the back area and despite their being other customers in the back section, it still felt intimate. Price: As someone who spent a lot of time looking for bridal shower brunch locations, a fixed brunch at $25 per person with unlimited drinks and a three hour time window is a rarity. You really can't beat the brunch prices at Palo Santo. It is one of the only places I have been to where you feel like you get MORE than you pay for. For a bridal party on a budget, this was key.

First, the back room, which was ours exclusively, is a gorgeous and warm space, particularly on a cold January night. There was plenty of room for all of us to mingle over wine before taking our seats for dinner. Speaking of wine, the chef/owner helped me pick out 2 delicious (and reasonably priced) bottles for the group - one red and one white - and we just counted up the bottles at the end of the night....couldn't be easier. Obviously, the main event was the food. \\xc2\\xa0As Palo Santo is a market driven restaurant, the menu was not decided until the day of (love surprises, so that was fine). We had a three course prix fixe dinner (only $25!??!) that included the most wonderful, zesty and rich duck soup I've ever had in my life. \\xc2\\xa0Other appetizers included flounder ceviche (tried this too - also delicious) and salad. \\xc2\\xa0Entrees included a vegetarian mushroom dish (sorry veggies, I didn't get to try it, but it got rave reviews), an outrageous roasted cod with a white sweet potato and avocado salsa and rabbit in a mole sauce. Every dish was absolutely delicious, beautifully plated and came to the table piping hot - pretty amazing considering how big the group was. Service was warm and wonderful, as well. Following the dinner, many of my friends contacted me to let me know what a downright splendid time they had and how much they enjoyed the food. What more could I ask for?

The only weakness might\\'ve been with the appetizers -- I wasn\\'t as excited by the options as I was for the entrees, but I think it may simply be a matter of description, rather than the food itself (the simple listing of \"avocado\" does not do the presentation justice). My entree (heritage pork) was divine. \\xc2\\xa0Only complaint to be had was that the side salad/melange it came with was on some kind of bread/wheat-based product that was a bit too hard on the bottom to effectively cut into pieces. \\xc2\\xa0But the flavors and presentation were spot on. \\xc2\\xa0My friend got the plantain stew, which was rich, complex, and subtle in its flavor. \\xc2\\xa0As someone who resists ordering the veg options, I\\'d reconsider my stance for the plantain stew. And I will certainly be coming back for more, including the tasting menu. \\xc2\\xa0I\\'m a finicky eater, but this place was spot-on. \\xc2\\xa0And for those of you into greener pursuits, it appears that a number of the greens come from the roof-top garden.

I felt like I was in the lower level/basement of one of those smaller grungy clubs in the LES. Towards the front of the shop the tables are soooo tightly packed next to one another, so that when you get up and walk around (to take a phone call or use the bathroom) you have to constantly maneuver around the tables so as to not knock a drink over or disturb another patron. What really irked me though was the barista's shitty attitude and lack of attention to customers. I stood in front of the register for about two minutes staring plainly at the cashier/server (who appeared to be the only person on staff) while he fiddled with a few things behind the counter and looked aimlessly at other patrons, before he acknowledged that I was there, trying to make a purchase. I am not looking for someone to hold the door open when I enter, and I am not even looking for a greeting, but at least have the decency to acknowledge your customers and take an order. To top it off, he seemed annoyed by the fact that I would dare buy something. In any case, unluckily for me I was just a few days removed from a wisdom tooth removal, so my teeth were understandably sore and very sensitive. I ordered the mint lemonade and asked him for no ice. He filled the 16 ounce cup a TINY BIT PAST halfway and stared at me very smugly as he handed me what amounted to a $3 drink (THREE DOLLAR DRINK) that would be done in two gulps. It was definitely far less than what you'd receive from a standard 12 ounce can. To top it off, later on when I asked him where the bathroom was he seemed annoyed by the question and mumbled an answer under his breath as he very coyly gestured to the general vicinity of the bathroom. Moreover there is one single occupant bathroom with no markings to indicate that it is a restroom. So after he directed me to the general vicinity he watched me as I foolishly paced back and forth in the back room looking for the restroom. Finally, I entered a door which looked like it led to some back room/kitchen area (which had SHADY written all over it) only to use a restroom with no soap or paper towels.

First major issue, our noodles took more than half an hour to come AFTER our appetizers of spicy cucumber and fried chicken were finished. We were greeted by a half mumbled apology. Second mistake was the waitress made a mistake on my order and gave me the warm soba without pork. Rather than offer to take the bowl away and add the pork, they offered to add the pork in a side dish. This took 10 minutes, by which time my noodles were cold and my 6 month old was screaming.

Order anything over the yellow rice, and you won't be disappointed. My favorite is the pork souvlaki, with the Greek-and-Mild sauce mix, over rice. Get a baklava dessert or two to go, for that lovely cinnamon, cardamom, ambrosia honey, and toasted walnut taste on a light, deliciously flaky filo crust, and the rest of your day will be amazing. 51st and Park almost every day. Be there if you want a FANTASTIC meal, served by a great team.

It's atleast a mile, but the yelp reviews have convinced me that it's good, so I had to do it. One day, just on a whim I walked to 51st and Park where it's located. And then I see the line next to the blue truck. The line doesn't move as fast as in a McDonalds/subway, but it isn't slow either. I ordered rice platter with w. extra chicken, spicy and very little white sauce. I don't usually get white sauce, cuz on the carts, it's just another name for mayo. But to my surprise, the white sauce from these guys is good. No trace of mayo whatever, and I later learned that this is called tzatziki and is made of sour cream (or I wish greek yogurt). Awesome.... My meal was great. The rice is nothing special, but the meat was just right. It's dark chicken and if you want white meat, I think it's $2 extra. I like dark chicken myself so no problem for me. And the extra meat for a buck is a bargain. I paid 6$ in total, and was full. Didn't feel hungry at all later. I love this place.

He was \\xc2\\xa0offensive and completely lacking customer service skills. They ordered crisps and falafel sandwiches, but Ian ended up giving them falafel burgers. When they brought it up to his attention, instead of apologizing for his mistake and rectifying the situation, he became very dismissive and argumentative. One of the workers there realized what was happening and wanted to re-do everything the right way, as initially ordered, however, Ian jumped in and aggressively stopped the process. Although shocked and very disappointed, my friends tried to calmly explain to him once again that it was his mistake and that he misunderstood the orders - he simply refused to listen to them. cumstomer satisfaction was clearly not on his priority list.. Needless to say, my friends are very unhappy with today's experience and so am I. They brought me back something I did not order, but what Ian decided to give me... a very small burger (instead of a falafel sandwich).. It had very little Babaganoush that one could barely even taste it and it was so small that I now have to go buy something else to eat - it was the size of a snack... Way to go, Ian!!!

       " 'better than trellis, but thats not saying much the menu is ameture. you can tell it was created by a hobbyist, and not a chef. it has no congruity or flow, too much variety with not enough total items available. the food tends to be either really unhealthy (fatty, salty, fried, cheesed, gravy\\'d, etc), or bland and unpalletable. there is not a single healthy option on the menu besides a side of carrots and celery (mind you, it comes with blue cheese dressing). i have purchased several different meals from here, both dine-in and take-out, and have yet to be pleased with anything. add to this the fact that the food is priced as if it is balducci or cittorella quality, yet delivered closer to mcdonalds quality and this place is not for the hungry. the drink selection is reasonable, prices are reasonable during happy hour. besides the drinks, the only thing this place has going for it are the cute girls that work there (they cant wait tables, but they are friendly and nice to look at), hiring young cuties seems to be the only good business decision the owner has made. my advice is to eat a sandwich at home and hit this 2nd rate hooters for cheap_o pitchers of coors light. then jump on the tram and hit the strip club for a nite-cap. my advice for the owner is to firre the chef, hire a professional, write a real \"grown up\" menu, and feature 3 distinct healthy entree options. also establish a complete prix fixed brunch menu that includes a morning drink and coffee, AND CHOICES OF DECENT OPTIONS, for under $17 and youll get my business back.',\n",

Perhaps with increased competition, Riverwalk will start to improve the quality of their food, and hire better cooks. Other than that, it is not a bad place to have a few drinks, and watch the game. I agree with Bo in reference to the tip charge, they hold on to the change. When I asked why this was done, they said that it was the policy. Although he offered to give it back, the damage was done, and I told him to keep it. However, this tactic appears under-handed, and could be illegal. They need to re-think this practice.\",\n",

The bartenders-- all of them-- were unfailingly helpful and friendly. \\xc2\\xa0I took the bartenders' suggestions for an afternoon snack and wine and it was all good and not expensive.

Particularly at $30 entrees, where many other restaurants with equivalent food quality and price point have nailed their service. Clearly, you see where i'm going...Balaboosta lost points with me due to a few seemingly small but important service blunders that in the end tainted the overall experience. So what happened: the busboy was gruff, and in his manner of clearing the table inevitably splashed \\xc2\\xa0my face and clothing with oily dish residue, all while clanking silverware near my face and ears. Some people would dismiss this as an accident or a one-off experience. I actually attribute it to poor staff training. I quietly let the manager know what happened as I was leaving, first complimenting the restaurant on the cuisine. The manager was polite, however she did not apologize and responded by awkwardly justifying the quality and reputation of the food, the open kitchen...huh?

Quite, quite, small as it turns out. \\xc2\\xa0 The atmosphere was so laid back that the prices seemed out of place. \\xc2\\xa0The ceviche was probably my favorite thing I tried, but I had literally half a fork full when it was split between 5 of us. The fried olives were fantastic, and I'm not even an olive lover. \\xc2\\xa0 There was a dish of shrimp wrapped in phyllo dough with flying fish roe and wasabi sauce which was also amazing. Perfect scallops, just... perfect. \\xc2\\xa0 The eggplant bruschetta, grilled pizza, and the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts were all lovely. Skippables were the quinoa salad, the pickle plate, the DIY hummus (the bread was nice but the hummus was pretty dull... as for having to grind it yourself- not really. \\xc2\\xa0It was pretty much ready made hummus in a mortar with a few unground garbanzos on top).

We sampled a lot of different appetizers, and I also had the skirt steak as a main dish. The falafel meatballs were amazing! I've never had anything like them before, and it's well worth a trip here for these. The chickpea layer gave way to a ground beef center, and the two flavors complimented each other perfectly. Another highlight of the appetizers was the cauliflower. There was a layer of lemon on top of the crunchy cauliflower, which was fried but not too oily. The pine nuts added a nice nutty bite as well. Between the falafel meatballs and the cauliflower, I was in heaven. The one appetizer that I did not love was the hummus. I prefer my hummus very thick and smooth, and the one here was rough, with chunky chick peas on top. It was not seasoned with enough spice or olive oil for my taste. It was, however, incredibly fresh. The skirt steak was delicious too, and I loved the potatoes it was served with. Everything arrived hot. We had malabi for dessert, which tasted like panna cotta. The nuts on top added some nice texture. Our waiters were so nice! We had one waiter, who I think was Assaf, who was super-nice, but then all the other waiters helped out when they could. There was definitely a team effort going on. Everyone was very friendly. It really added to the atmosphere. Usually, every dish has to be perfect for me to give a restaurant five stars, but Balaboosta had that something special, which made me overlook the only dish I wasn't crazy about. The food is super fresh, and it has that pop, that zing!, those unique flavors that are rare to find.\",\n",

We noticed a table behind us that came in after us had gotten the same dish that we were still waiting on.

We paid for the food my friend was eating and the appetizer and walked out. She did not try to stop us or even apologize.

That\\'s why it was so upsetting to recently have an experience there that was unpleasant. The last thing in the world I want is a reason to NOT go to Beco since it\\'s one of the few bars with live music that I love in NYC.

I thought maybe she was just a little flustered, but it turned out she just didn\\'t care. About halfway through our meal as she was clearing a table behind us she placed a full glass of water face down on a finished plate of food and then as she tried to get by us with it she spilled the entire glass (actually plate!) of water down my back, all over my jacket and sweater. I wasn\\'t going to say a word, but my wife was really upset about it, especially since the waitress didn\\'t even say \"sorry,\" but just kept on moving after doing it.

In fact, as I stood at the bar trying to reason with her, she just got nasty, and then the bartender (also a woman) came over to defend her and said \"What do you want? Us to pay for your dry cleaning?\" I said, \"No, all I wanted was some acknowledgment that if you spill water all over someone, you say \\'I\\'m sorry.\\'\" Neither of them was willing to give me that, at least, not without attitude.

We had to practically beg for everything--it is no exaggeration to say we ordered every round of drinks and plates at least three times. I will give them a break that everything took 30min to an hour arrive because it was packed for the final of the Confederations Cup and Brazil was busy beating Spain 3 to 0. After we'd already spent over $250 and waited for the closing 20 mins of the game, the waitress came and said 'you either need to consume more or I'm closing your check and clearing your table.' of course they showed up promptly when it was time to cash in and get our bill, which only suggests the lousy service was more a choice than anything. When the check arrived, they'd mischarged us for two pitchers of caipirinhas (adding $15 to the total) and then charged us for four instead of three pitchers (bringing the extra charge above what we consumed to $45). When I brought it to the waitress's attention, she even tried to argue with all 5 of us, which was, obviously, insulting. I've never had such terrible service anywhere. It's a real shame, as the food is good. We won't be going back.\",\n",

Fish with spinach and heirloom tomatoes. It was delightful until about a quarter of the way into the meal, I took a bite and realized something just wasn't quite right. Somehow, a habanero pepper had made it's way into the tomatoes. Honest mistake in the kitchen - I get it! They were the same color, right? Needless to say, my mouth was on fire. I can't even describe to you the pain. My mouth, I believe, was still sore later that evening. I'm not a difficult person to please. I don't complain about food in restaurants.

I guess in a restaurant with such an amazing reputation, I thought we'd get a little more of an apology. I don't know what I expected.

The calamari, while I\\'m sure \\'pretzel-dusted\\', tasted like the same fried calamari you\\'ve had everywhere else. \\xc2\\xa0The crab toast was so-so, the insane prices for side dishes ($11 for peas and carrots) were hilarious, yet I felt compelled to try a few, thinking that Jean Georges must know what he\\'s doing, right? \\xc2\\xa0Wrong. \\xc2\\xa0The jalepeno corn was somehow both spicy yet completely bland... was swimming in a thin/runny cream, and while once stirred with the mound of cheese piled on top (it\\'s only saving grace) it was edible, I literally cannot say the same for the mashed potatoes. \\xc2\\xa0I\\'ve never been served such an overly salted dish at any of NYC\\'s fine dining establishments... while pureed (and probably sieved) smooth, they were crunchy with sea salt chunks, and after two bites (one which left me in shock, the second to confirm how hilariously disgusting they were), I was done. The fried chicken, while not as comically bad as the mashed potatoes, was an oddly massive pile of what appeared to be a de-boned half chicken flattened on top of a bed of greens. \\xc2\\xa0The entire dish was confusingly larger than ever other entree on offer. \\xc2\\xa0The crispy fried exterior was good, and the chicken inside was ok, but the curious bed of greens (which I initially confused for straight basil, but later determined, after asking a server, to be an odd combination of whole-leaf basil, dill and some spinach) was ridiculously bad. \\xc2\\xa0 At the end of the meal (we couldn\\'t stomach dessert) the female server who cleared our table (and was much more polite than our bitchy male server) asked if everything had been to my liking, since I hadn\\'t eaten much of my meal. \\xc2\\xa0While I probably should have complained, at that point it seemed too late to even begin. \\xc2\\xa0 As an aside, my party found it odd that the only beef entree on the menu was a cheeseburger (aside from one pork and one chicken entree, everything else was seafood). \\xc2\\xa0All in all, it\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve overpaid this much to poke around and play with my food like a 7 year old... never eating any of it. We should have gone to Minetta...',\n",
       " 'Not worth the trip. \\xc2\\xa0Have been excited about going to this place for some time. \\xc2\\xa0We could only get a late reservation, but figured if we sat down at 10:00 (the time of the reservation) that would be fine. \\xc2\\xa0We had heard great things and really were hoping to not be disappointed. We literally waited 35 minutes to be seated, during which we received perhaps one comment from a hostess that they were sorry we were waiting. \\xc2\\xa0As the 30 minute mark approached, they starting promising to \"take care of us\" over and over and over again, so we didn\\'t really complain and just dealt with the absurdly long wait. The food was good - not the best we\\'ve had - but some things really did stand out (the squash toast was superb). \\xc2\\xa0Others, like the cod, were absolutely drenched in oil/grease and simply did not taste good. \\xc2\\xa0 When the bill came, we were surprised to see that the only way they \"took care of us\" was bringing us a cheap appetizer for free. \\xc2\\xa0Normally I would be fine with that, but when you\\'re not seated until 10:45 and it\\'s already that late and you\\'re promised to be taken care of by 4 different people, it\\'s almost a slap in the face that our drinks or dessert or something else wasn\\'t done to make us feel better about what shaped up to be a less-than-memorable experience. In the past, when this has happened at other restaurants, we\\'ve had managers come over and profusely apologize and comp our entire meals, or our drinks, or bring us multiple dishes as a means of apologizing for a mistake they made. \\xc2\\xa0When you have hostesses constantly stating they\\'ll take care of you and then the waiter reiterating this, we were frankly appalled by ABC\\'s lack of client service. \\xc2\\xa0You simple won\\'t make it in this city if you can\\'t treat your clientele with the respect they deserve. I don\\'t care how good or new a restaurant you are - if you can\\'t seat your customers within a reasonable time of arriving, you\\'re failing. \\xc2\\xa0And if that does happen, you need to make much more of an effort to appease those who clearly are frustrated - especially when it\\'s that late in the evening and they\\'ve been waiting to eat for so long. \\xc2\\xa0It really is a shame.',\n",
       " 'ith all the reviews and hype about the restaurant, it was somewhat disappointing. Noise level too loud, the lighting too low, but the all white atmosphere would have looked like a chic hospital waiting room otherwise. The wine was good, and made the rest of the evening tolerable. The carrot and avocado did not advise that there was an abundance of cumin spice, the bean side dish was overcooked, oily and cold, the pasta was mediocre, but the single serving of portable mushroom was nicely cooked. The peach cobbler was more dough than peach, but the ice cream was good, but the grape sorbet tasted like a popsicle. The service was attentive to refilling the water, and when complained about the beans, there was an offer to reheat.',\n",
       " \"I had the worst $25 hamburger in my life. \\xc2\\xa0It was small and overdone. The bun was stale and tasteless. \\xc2\\xa0It's a great looking room and cool crowd but horrible food and only fair service.\",\n",
       " 'It was my birthday, and I was feeling spontaneous... nothing could get in my way. Could I get in at ABC Kitchen, the trendy farmstand-to-table restaurant for which I heard so much praise? I called, asked for a return call if any reservations were cancled, and to my surprise found out a few hours later that I was one of the lucky few, the guilded dreamers who could taste heaven.. or so I thought. Overestimating how long it would take us to catch a train, we arrived for our reservation 20 minutes early. The hostess, looking at us with a forced smile, informed us with a blunt burst that \"your table won\\'t be ready until your reservation.\" We knoded politely, waiting for her to finish with the expected \"but you can wait at the bar\" or \"feel free to take a seat at the counter over there,\" but she just looked away. We were so put off by her attitude that we decided to walk down to Union Square and wait there. When we returned, we sat down and were handed menus from our waiter, who we believe was also a bartender at one of the small corner bars. He seemed to almost pride himself on showing us as little attention as possible, as we had to flag him down anytime we wanted anything (and then wait 10 minutes while he talked to people at the bar). We ordered the salmon tartar toast and pretzel dusted calamari for appetizer... The tartar literally tasted like the bagel and lox I sometimes get from the corner bakery on my way to work, or a Philadelphia sushi roll I get from the cafeteria in my office. There was nothing really exceptional about it, especially for $16. The pretzel dusted calamari - could have gone to any pub or bar and gotten the same thing with better sauce. The cold marinara that came with it was grossly (I am tempted to say criminally) underseasoned; I make a lot of homemade marinara sauce, and ABC\\'s version tasted like when I just get the pot cooking (when the tomatoes still have that unsavory raw flavor). It needed to cook for a few more hours to not taste like canned diced tomatoes. We gathered ourselves, saying \"oh, we must have just gotten a poor hand with the appetizers... I\\'m sure it gets better.\" Sadly, our optimism was unfounded. We got two dishes to share between us - a pasta fish with a pesto of ramps and pecorino, and a filet of halibut served in a morel mushroom sauce. When the dishes came out, they were very pretty. The pesto was a striking green, and the halibut looked like a cloud floating in a lake of fava beans, morels, shallots, etc. After glancing at our food, we looked up to our waiter to ask for some freshly ground pepper; alas, he had already run away without saying a word to us... no \"enjoy your meal\" or \"anything else?\" I am a huge pesto fan, whether it be made traditionally for basil or some other herb combination. However, this pesto, although admitedly good on the initial bite, left an unpallatable aftertaste similar to the smell of freshly mowed grass, if that makes sense. I like my noodles to have a good amount of bite to them, but these sadly were verging on mushy (they could barely hold up to turning with a fork without falling apart). It definitely wasn\\'t a horrible dish, but it was nothing to write home about. The halibut was good - I like a lot of acidity, and the sauce that accompanied it was very tart and to my liking (except for the squash puree that was underneath the fish, as it was a little too sour). The dish, however, seriously lacked in texture - I felt as though I were eating a dish designed for a nursing home. Some kind of crunch would have elevated the dish. The worst part of the night was by far the poor service from the staff. After being ignored throughout the night and enjoying an expensive, subpar meal, we were ready to get out of Jack and go home. In the midst of talking about how overrated this place is, our waiter did another drive-by and literally plopped the dessert menus in the middle of the table without looking at either of us (believe me, he definitely couldn\\'t hear what we were saying because that would take some ounce of attentiveness). My friend and I looked at each other with jaws dropped in complete disbelief. He went back behind the bar, and my friend turned around and made the check-sign in the air, to which the waiter responded with a knod so blas\\xc3\\xa9. He then continued talking to the two ladies sitting at the bar (mind you we were honest-to-god sitting 10 feet from him), and continued talking to them for another 10 minutes. With our faces becoming increasing flush, he finally stopped talking and made his way over to our table. He handed us the check and with an unexpected sign of humanity told us to \"have a good night, guys,\" to which I responded in my most sarcastic voice and rolling eyes \"mmmmmm yeaa.\" We payed and hurried our way out the door. Happy birthday to me.',\n",
       " 'We went for a birthday brunch on Sunday, and although we were seated late in the afternoon, most of the items on the menu were not available, and we were not informed of this until 25 minutes after we had placed our order. It took over an hour to get our food, even though the restaurant was not packed, and the entree portions were either really big or really small. \\xc2\\xa0Overall, it was a disappointing experience. \\xc2\\xa0Food was good but not worth the wait or the money.',\n",
       " \"This review is based entirely on service. \\xc2\\xa0We took 8 people to dinner the other night and the place was packed as usual. \\xc2\\xa0Our client got us the reservation as they have connections. \\xc2\\xa0They had never been there and we had bragged about the place so she said fine let's go. \\xc2\\xa0Our client needed ice for her drink, nobody came to our table. \\xc2\\xa0I finally had to go ask our waitress who was at another table could we please have some ice for one of our guests. \\xc2\\xa0It took another 5-10 minutes and we finally got some ice. \\xc2\\xa0We never got any food for over an hour. \\xc2\\xa0When food finally arrived nobody came to check if we needed anything. \\xc2\\xa0We needed some lemon for the fish and chips but it came when we were ready to order dessert as I had to leave the table to find someone to get it for us. \\xc2\\xa0I think the server may have been new but maybe the restaurant should have more servers so that people can have a little better service. \\xc2\\xa0It was just very embarrassing in front of this client as it was our suggestion and she was highly disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"When I entered the shop the inner was eye-catching. But the problem of this place is with the service. There are no clear lines for ordering and paying and customers are just randomly scattered in the shop waiting to get served. So when you think it's your turn to order, they ring up the person who is sitting at a table already eating their food. Oh, yeah--the food. It's decent, certainly not superb or inspiring in any way, but okay. Everything is pretty much pre-made. But the food that's just sitting there and served reheated upon request.\",\n",
       " \"i went to abc kitchen after seeing a ton of friends checking in to it on facebook. i dragged my husband against his will and found ourselves making a reservation for brunch. we were the first of many to arrive and many tables were open despite the hype and unwillingness to allow us to change our reservation time. all that aside, the food was not worth it. plain and simple. i ordered a salad with poached chicken. i found the flavors were nice however, a problem is very apparent when the salad has SAND in it. my husband ordered a pizza with egg on it and found the entire thing to be very soggy and hard to eat. the service was ok at best and i will not find myself revisiting. a friend of mine told me about her plans to go to abc kitchen and i tried to advise her against it. she went anyways and was also disappointed. the best thing i can say about this place is that its very well hyped. that's it.\",\n",
       " 'Seven of us ate at ABC Kitchens last night and we all agreed that the food was amazing but the service was as bad as it gets. The side dishes came after the meal, dessert after we finished our coffee and after asking for more coffee it came after we finished our dessert- forget about milk or sugar. Simply stated, total neglect. We were forever waving our arms to get the attention of our servers to either pour wine or order. It got so bad that we embarrassingly had to ask our servers their names because we were so tired of saying \"excuse me\". As good as the Pizza, Crab, Chicken, Halibut Suckling Pig and desserts were, I would never eat in a place tha is so rude and incommunicative again for the average price of $100 per person.',\n",

       " 'Tried twice to like this restaurant and it failed miserably both times and its all due to the service. This most recent time we came in, were greeted and the hostess said we would have a table in a few moments. \\xc2\\xa0If we had known it was going to be 20 minutes we would have tried to get a drink but when we got tired of waiting for them to get us for the table and tried to get that drink, the bartenders were too concerned with their own conversation to give us the time of day (had their backs to the bar- big NO NO) Made it to the table eventually. \\xc2\\xa0The waitress was very nice. \\xc2\\xa0My husband works in the business so the kitchen sent out a bunch of extras to our table. \\xc2\\xa0They could have been coursed out better but whatever, the food was all very very good. \\xc2\\xa0In the middle of our courses my husband was still eating off one of the salad plates and the waitress came over and took away his share plate from under him- food was still on the fork!!!! BIG NO NO. \\xc2\\xa0To top off the evening, the waitress came over, knocked the candle onto the floor spilling wax everywhere- on my purse, my husbands jacket, and his shoes. \\xc2\\xa0Are you serious? \\xc2\\xa0I would have appreciated someone offering to dry clean our items even if we would never have taken it but all we got was a pathetic \"Sorry\".
